<p class="calibre1">This free-running oscillator is modulated via the screen grid. The preceding modulation </p>
<p class="calibre1">amplifier operates in triode mode to achieve a sufficiently large, distortion-free modulation despite the low anode voltage. The operating point is adjusted with a trimmer to minimize </p>
<p class="calibre1">distortion. The characteristic curves of both stages are oppositely curved due to the phase </p>
<p class="calibre1">shift of the modulation amplifier. With an optimal adjustment, the resulting distortion is </p>
<p class="calibre1">largely cancelled out, allowing for a large modulation range of up to about 50%. There is a </p>

<p class="calibre1">The term DDS stands for 'Direct Digital Synthesis’ and describes the digital generation of </p>
<p class="calibre1">a repetitive waveform at a defined frequency. To generate a sine wave the core of a DDS </p>
<p class="calibre1">oscillator uses a table of sine waveform values stored in ROM. A DAC takes the sine wave </p>
<p class="calibre1">values and converts them into an output voltage. A phase accumulator serves as an ad-</p>
<p class="calibre1">dress pointer to the sine table and keeps track of the instantaneous phase of the waveform. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The desired output frequency is represented by a digital value called the frequency tuning </p>
<p class="calibre1">word. This value determines the rate at which the phase accumulator increments to give </p>
<p class="calibre1">the desired output frequency. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The quality of the output signal depends on the resolution of the DAC and the size of the </p>
<p class="calibre1">sine table. The AD9835 uses a 10-bit converter and a sine table with 4096 support values. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The phase accumulator has a width of 32 bits, with only the upper 12 bits determining the </p>
<p class="calibre1">address of the current output value. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The original software-defined radio for shortwave up to 30 MHz (see Section 8.6) was an </p>
<p class="calibre1">interesting project, but there were issues sourcing an alternative for the discontinued PLL </p>
<p class="calibre1">chip. Then the SI5351 clock chip from Silicon Labs came along. The Adafruit breakout board </p>
<p class="calibre1">was used for the initial experiments. There is also a useful Arduino library to support it. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Figure 5.31: The Adafruit SI5351 board. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">With all this help and an Arduino Uno, it was possible to build on the Elektor SDR project </p>
<p class="calibre1">and expand its capabilities. The SI5351 is now a key component in the Elektor SDR Shield </p>
<p class="calibre1">(Section 8.7). Thanks to its excellent characteristics, numerous possibilities are now available, including digital data transmission, for example, with a WSPR transmitter or for HF </p>
<p class="calibre1">measurement applications. </p>

<p class="calibre1">It’s not necessary to always use an Arduino board to control the SI5351 it can of course </p>
<p class="calibre1">be interfaced to much smaller microcontroller. In fact, Andrew Woodfield, ZL2PD, has pro-</p>

<p class="calibre1">two of the PLL outputs of the SI5351 simultaneously by driving both internal PLLs. Any </p>
<p class="calibre1">slight change in the frequency is tracked by the PLL while the divide-ratio settings of the </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 6 • Direct Mixers</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Direct mixers consist of an oscillator and a mixer and convert an RF input signal to a base-</p>
<p class="calibre1">band (usually audio) signal in one step. They are suitable for receiving SSB and CW broad-</p>
<p class="calibre1">casts as well as digital broadcasts such as DRM. Compared to a regenerative receiver the </p>
<p class="calibre1">mixer achieves better frequency stability. An oscillator with low phase noise is important for error-free reception of DRM broadcasts. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">6.1 Mixer Types</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Mixer circuits convert input frequencies to other frequency ranges. In a superheterodyne </p>
<p class="calibre1">receiver, the mixer converts the received signal to an intermediate frequency (IF) (see<b class="calibre3"> </b>Figure 6.1). In contrast, a direct-conversion mixer or zero-IF mixer converts the signal directly to the audio frequency (AF) range. Such receivers are used, for example, in simple amateur </p>
<p class="calibre1">radio applications. For DRM reception, the signal is converted to the 12 kHz range, and it is only a question of definition whether to call the output signal an AF or an IF. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Figure 6.1: Block diagram of a medium wave superhet radio. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">A direct mixer directly converts the received signal to the audio frequency range, without </p>
<p class="calibre1">the use of an intermediate frequency. It consists of an oscillator and a mixer and is com-</p>
<p class="calibre1">monly used in simple amateur radio applications. Due to the finite Q factor of the resonant </p>
<p class="calibre1">circuit, image frequency suppression is only possible at low frequencies (long wave). </p>
<p class="calibre1">In this text, mixer types are described in connection to their use in a superheterodyne type of receiver with an IF amplifier. However, the same circuit can also be used as a direct mixer by tapping off the baseband signal instead of the intermediate frequency. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One particularly simple and commonly used mixer is the multiplying mixer stage which </p>
<p class="calibre1">uses a single transistor. When two sinusoidal signals are applied to a multiplier, the output signal contains the sum and difference frequencies of the two input signals, in addition to </p>
<p class="calibre1">the two original signals. In this case, multiplication means that the gain of one signal is </p>
<p class="calibre1">directly controlled by the instantaneous value of the second signal. A variable gain amplifier is therefore necessary, the gain of which can be adjusted directly by an oscillator signal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A single transistor can be used to mix multiple frequencies when biased at the appropriate </p>
<p class="calibre1">operating point and both signals are applied to the base. This method of signal processing is also known as an additive mixer. Considering the gain of the transistor as the product of its </p>

<p class="calibre1">transconductance and external resistance and noting that the transconductance is propor-</p>
<p class="calibre1">tional to the collector current, a change in the collector current due to the oscillator signal is sufficient to multiply the input signal with the oscillator signal. The input signal should be small enough so that it only operates over a narrow region of the transconductance slope, </p>
<p class="calibre1">i.e., being kept below 1 mV. The oscillator signal, on the other hand, should modulate the </p>
<p class="calibre1">collector current as linearly as possible and without overloading it. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Figure 6.2: A slope multiplier used as a mixer. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Figure 6.2 shows a simple mixer using an NPN transistor in a Superheterodyne application. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The low impedance oscillator signal is coupled to the emitter and directly modulates the </p>
<p class="calibre1">collector current. The current feedback using emitter coupling ensures good linearity. The </p>
<p class="calibre1">input signal is fed directly to the transistor base. This signal must be relatively small to ensure the transistor is not driven beyond its narrow effective operating region. The collector current therefore contains the mixed down converted signal, from which the intermediate </p>
<p class="calibre1">frequency can be filtered out to recover the desired baseband signal. The mixer operating </p>
<p class="calibre1">point should be stabilized to ensure consistent results. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In principle, both signals could also be applied to the transistor base. Figure 6.3 shows a </p>
<p class="calibre1">simplified version of the mixer, with the operating point stabilization omitted for clarity of principle. It’s important that the oscillator signal is large enough to modulate the collector current and the input signal is small enough not to create distortion. In simple receivers, </p>
<p class="calibre1">self-oscillating mixer stages are often used, where the oscillator transistor also serves as the mixer. A regenerative transistor stage can also be regarded as a mixer of this type. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The simple mixer circuit shown in Figure 6.3 is practically no different from the basic circuit for a single transistor emitter amplifier. This means that practically any amplifier can also become a mixer if you supply it with two signals of different frequencies and appropriate </p>
<p class="calibre1">signal amplitudes. This also poses a danger because most of the time, the frequency mix </p>
<p class="calibre1">needs to undergo further processing. The input amplifier in a shortwave receiver often has </p>
<p class="calibre1">to deal with very strong signals alongside very weak signals. It can happen that one of the </p>
<p class="calibre1">stronger signals acts like an oscillator signal and generates mixing products. This phenom-</p>
<p class="calibre1">enon is called intermodulation or cross-modulation. This generates numerous interference </p>
<p class="calibre1">signals that disturb the reception of weak signals. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The same applies to the transistor in a mixing stage such as in Figure 6.2. In addition to </p>
<p class="calibre1">the oscillator signal, other high levels input signals can also lead to mixing products. The interference immunity of such a mixing stage is therefore not particularly high. They are </p>
<p class="calibre1">still used in simple radio receivers where high sensitivity or immunity to high input signals are not important properties. For better performance more sophisticated mixers must be </p>
<p class="calibre1">used. A shortwave receiver, as used in amateur radio applications, should be able to cope </p>
<p class="calibre1">with signals in the sub 1 µV range as well as much stronger signals of up to 100 mV with-</p>
<p class="calibre1">out distortion. This wide dynamic range is only possible if the mixer characteristics are </p>
<p class="calibre1">extremely linear for the entire input signal range. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dual-gate field-effect transistors (DG-MOSFETs) such as the BF961 can be used to build </p>
<p class="calibre1">a mixer with a good dynamic range. Used as amplifiers, they have a linear characteristic </p>
<p class="calibre1">curve and therefore produce low distortion. The steepness of the transistor characteristic </p>
<p class="calibre1">can be modulated via the second gate. Using appropriate adjustment of the gate voltages </p>
<p class="calibre1">and a suitable oscillator level, good dynamic range is achievable. Dual-gate MOSFETs are </p>
<p class="calibre1">commonly used in shortwave and FM receivers mainly because they lead to reduced circuit </p>
<p class="calibre1">complexity. </p>

<p class="calibre1">A single diode can also be used as a mixer. In the circuit shown in Figure 6.5, both signals are first added together. The envelope of the resulting mixed signal contains the desired </p>
<p class="calibre1">mixing products. A rectifier is all you need to extract them. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Figure 6.5: A diode mixer. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">An additive mixer has good ability to handle large signals. One disadvantage is that more </p>
<p class="calibre1">than two frequency products are created in the mixing process. The oscillator signal is now </p>
<p class="calibre1">no longer a sinusoid but appears as a square wave because of the diode switching charac-</p>
<p class="calibre1">teristics. The signal now includes odd harmonics of the oscillator signal i.e., 3  <i class="calibre4">fOSC, 5 f</i> OSC, etc. Each of these harmonics also generates corresponding mixed products. For a demodulator, this is not significant, as signals with multiples of the carrier frequency are far enough away from the wanted baseband signal so that they can be removed with a low-pass filter </p>
<p class="calibre1">that will be required anyway. At the receiver front-end they can be suppressed by filters. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In principle, a transistor or field-effect transistor such as the BF245 can also be used as </p>
<p class="calibre1">the active element in a mixer. A JFET has the advantage of very fast switching times and </p>
<p class="calibre1">lower levels of distortion. In the circuit shown in Figure 6.6, a negative bias voltage for the field-effect transistor is automatically established. The FET acts like a switch that repeated-ly shorts the input signal. This type of large-signal mixer is used, for example, as a second mixer in the DRM receiver covered in Section 7.4. </p>

<p class="calibre1">diodes are usually used because they have particularly fast switching times and generate </p>

<p class="calibre1">A low-cost, home-brew direct mixer design often relies on a freely tunable oscillator to </p>
<p class="calibre1">avoid the cost of a custom crystal or professional VFO. Ideally a direct mixer should have </p>
<p class="calibre1">the largest possible dynamic range to allow for the use of a better antenna in weak recep-</p>
<p class="calibre1">tion conditions. Experience with simple regenerative receivers has shown that the use of </p>
<p class="calibre1">a long antenna can lead to receiver front end overload and generation of intermodulation </p>
<p class="calibre1">products. A passive mixer without any mixing amplification inserted directly behind the </p>
<p class="calibre1">receiver front end can provide a solution if it has good interference rejection. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A JFET mixer is particularly simple and exhibits good large signal stability. If the FET is operated without a DC voltage, it essentially operates as a controlled resistor. An ideal passive resistor has a linear characteristic that does not generate any signal distortion. The FET </p>

<p class="calibre1">Radio Builder's Book</p>
<p class="calibre1">comes relatively close to this ideal. Therefore, even with less than optimal control, an FET </p>
<p class="calibre1">is a very good switch that can handle relatively large signals without producing intermodu-</p>
<p class="calibre1">lation products in a mixer configuration. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Figure 6.11: The FET Direct Mixer. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The circuit shown in Figure 6.11 was designed for use across the entire shortwave range </p>
<p class="calibre1">from 5.8 MHz upwards. The oscillator and input circuit use separate tuning capacitors, so </p>
<p class="calibre1">the circuits do not have to be adjusted for optimal synchronization. If necessary, the tuning range can be narrowed down to a specific band to allow for finer tuning. The oscillator coil has taps at around 20% and 50% of the total number of winding turns. A relatively loose </p>
<p class="calibre1">coupling with the transistor results in good frequency stability. </p>
<p class="calibre1">An oscillator signal of approximately 1 to 2 Vpp is sufficient at the gate of the BF245. The additional gate resistor prevents excessive damping of the oscillator network when the JFET </p>
<p class="calibre1">input diode enters a conductive state. The FET acts as a switch that provides a short to </p>
<p class="calibre1">ground in sync with the oscillator signal for the received signal from the coupled coil. This produces the audio signal at the output filter. The coupling coil has approximately 20% of </p>
<p class="calibre1">the number of turns at the antenna resonant coil. By changing this transformer ratio, an </p>
<p class="calibre1">optimal match can be found, with a small coupling factor resulting in a narrow input circuit bandwidth and improved noise immunity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The FET mixer offers good large-signal immunity but intermodulation products could be </p>
<p class="calibre1">generated further down the line in the audio stage. A low-pass filter is therefore inserted to reduce the signal bandwidth. Signals above 20 kHz are now sufficiently attenuated, so they </p>
<p class="calibre1">will not generate intermodulation products. The circuit was mainly used for DRM reception </p>
<p class="calibre1">in the 49 and 41-m bands. It showed no evidence of intermodulation effects even at high </p>
<p class="calibre1">field strengths using a long antenna. This allows for the use of an outdoor antenna which </p>
<p class="calibre1">suffers less from the effects of general domestic electrical interference. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The passive FET mixer does not provide any amplification on its own. The resulting audio </p>
<p class="calibre1">signals are therefore way down in the microvolt range. A single audio stage boosts the </p>
<p class="calibre1">signal level high enough for the microphone input of a PC sound card. Its overall sensitivity </p>

<p class="calibre1">In this test setup, a DDS signal generator is used to provide the local oscillator signal to a 4-diode ring mixer. The direct mixer uses a Mini Circuits TDM2 diode ring mixer and the </p>
<p class="calibre1">TUF-1 can also be used in its place. The DDS oscillator output signal level at 0 dBm was </p>
<p class="calibre1">raised by about 7 dBm using a BF494 transistor as a broadband amplifier. The baseband </p>
<p class="calibre1">signal recovered by the mixer is amplified by the low-noise B548C AF stage at the mixer </p>
<p class="calibre1">output. This provides sufficient signal level to directly drive the microphone input of a PC </p>
<p class="calibre1">sound card even with a poor RF. The mixer is terminated with about 50 Ω, resulting in good </p>
<p class="calibre1">large-signal stability. For best reception a long length of wire setup high outdoors can be </p>
<p class="calibre1">used for the antenna. If that is impractical a one to three meters length of wire stretched </p>
<p class="calibre1">out around the room can also do the job. There are no tuned resonant circuits or RF pre-</p>

<p class="calibre1">This receiver design operates without any input selector and uses a long wire antenna. At </p>
<p class="calibre1">the input, there is only a small, fixed value inductor. Using a long wire antenna, DRM signals can be received with an SNR of up to 20 dB. The mixer used in this receiver, however, is not quite as good as a diode mixer, possibly due to its poorer performance with large signals. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Overloading the mixer input will generate intermodulation products, which then interfere </p>

<p class="calibre1">A superheterodyne achieves better selectivity and also allows for the use of automatic gain </p>
<p class="calibre1">control (AGC). Here you will take a closer look at the technology and build some simple </p>
<p class="calibre1">superhet receiver designs. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">7.1 An AM Shortwave Receiver using the TCA440</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The TCA440 integrated circuit simplifies the construction of an AM superhet receiver, as all stages are combined in one IC. Figure 7.1 shows the typical structure of a freely tunable </p>
<p class="calibre1">receiver using a ceramic filter in the IF stage. The IC contains a regulated front-end and a regulated IF amplifier. The control voltage is obtained via a separate diode at the output </p>
<p class="calibre1">of the IF amplifier. The received signal strength can also be displayed on an S-meter. A </p>
<p class="calibre1">suitable audio amplifier stage is still required at the audio output. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Figure 7.1: Shortwave Superhet using the TCA440. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Building and tuning the oscillator and input circuits is the most challenging task when building a superhet. Both circuits must be finely tuned around the intermediate frequency with </p>
<p class="calibre1">good coherence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Figure 7.2 shows a variant of the receiver using varicap diodes for tuning. A potentiometer </p>
<p class="calibre1">or an external PLL such as the SAA1057 can be used to provide the tuning control voltage. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The RF coils used come from IF filters for 10.7 MHz and each has an additional 10-turn </p>
<p class="calibre1">coupler winding. The frequency range and coupling coefficient were determined experi-</p>
<p class="calibre1">mentally. Both circuits are tuned using a BB204 dual varicap diode. The oscillator circuit is adjusted via the coil’s screw-in slug which allows the PLL to lock in to the desired frequency range. The input circuit is then adjusted for maximum output signal amplitude. The circuit </p>
<p class="calibre1">has a high  <i class="calibre4">Q</i> and provides adequate image frequency rejection. Good synchronization of both circuits is achieved without difficulty in the range of 5.8 to 7.5 MHz if the input circuit is tuned precisely in the middle range. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The IF filters use ready-made coil filters for 455 kHz and the ceramic filter CFW455F. The </p>
<p class="calibre1">second oscillator is controlled by a CSB470 low cost ceramic resonator. Using the compo-</p>
<p class="calibre1">nent values shown, the frequency is pulled by 3 kHz to 467 kHz. The oscillator is sufficiently stable and precise to within 1 kHz without the need for any special adjustment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The demodulator uses a simple additive mixer using a germanium diode, which works well </p>
<p class="calibre1">here because the IF voltage at the output of the TCA440 is already at around 1 V. For dis-</p>
<p class="calibre1">tortion-free demodulation, it is important that the oscillator amplitude is greater than the signal amplitude at the coupling coil. An advantage of this simple demodulator is that it also works seamlessly for AM when the supply voltage to the second oscillator is switched off. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The TCA440 has significant overall gain, requiring the use of automatic gain control (AGC). </p>
<p class="calibre1">The control voltage is obtained using a second germanium diode, which coupled to the </p>
<p class="calibre1">output circuit via a 22 kΩ resistor, so that it does not load the signal and give rise to any distortion. This also results in a softer AGC characteristic so that a single interfering noise spike will not immediately reduce the gain. This slow reaction is more favorable for DRM </p>
<p class="calibre1">reception than a fast AGC response. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The second interface supplies the received signal information to the PC. Unlike a regular </p>
<p class="calibre1">radio, the output of the DRM receiver is not an audio signal that can be heard through </p>
<p class="calibre1">speakers or headphones. Instead, the DRM receiver mixes the signal of the DRM transmit-</p>
<p class="calibre1">ter down to an intermediate frequency of 12 kHz. The receiver output supplies a mixture </p>
<p class="calibre1">of modulated carrier frequencies that together transmit the audio signal as a digital data </p>
<p class="calibre1">stream. This DRM spectrum, a frequency mixture with a bandwidth of 10 kHz, is connected </p>
<p class="calibre1">to the line input of the PC’s sound card. The sound card digitizes the signal, and a DRM </p>
<p class="calibre1">receiving program, containing a DRM software demodulator/decoder as its core compo-</p>
<p class="calibre1">nent, is responsible for both demodulating the DRM signal and decoding the received data </p>
<p class="calibre1">stream. The audio signal is then available at the output of the sound card in stereo Hi-Fi </p>
<p class="calibre1">quality for playback through the PC’s speakers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The block diagram can be easily found in the circuit diagram after Figure 7.9. The DDS </p>
<p class="calibre1">oscillator with IC2 (see Section 5.9) supplies its signal via T1 to the first mixer (MIX1), a diode-ring mixer. The intermediate frequency of 455 kHz passes through a steep-slope ceramic filter (Fl1) with a bandwidth of 12 kHz. A IF amplifier stage with a BF494 (T2) boosts the level by about 20 dB before the signal is fed to the second mixer, a passive FET mixer </p>
<p class="calibre1">with a BF245 (T4). The second oscillator is stabilized by a ceramic resonator CSB470, which </p>
<p class="calibre1">is 'pulled’ by 3 kHz to 467 kHz. The resulting 12 kHz IF signal passes through a simple </p>
<p class="calibre1">bandpass filter and is again amplified and buffered by two opamps (IC3), before it is ready </p>
<p class="calibre1">at the output for connection to the PC sound card. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The most important characteristic for good DRM reception is phase purity of the mixer </p>
<p class="calibre1">oscillator. The DRM receiver meets the highest demands here: the DDS VFO generates an </p>
<p class="calibre1">extremely phase-pure oscillator signal. Another important characteristic is the receiver’s </p>
<p class="calibre1">large-signal rejection performance. The mixers used in this design offer excellent perfor-</p>
<p class="calibre1">mance in this regard so that with a simple wire antenna connected to the receiver input the </p>
<p class="calibre1">DRM software achieves 30 dB quieting. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Some properties of a receiver’s design are important for AM reception but are not so critical for DRM reception so these excellent results have been achieved here despite the receiver’s </p>
<p class="calibre1">simplified design and alignment-free setup. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The dynamic range of the PC sound card, together with the DRM software, is large enough </p>
<p class="calibre1">to cope with variations of the input signal of up to 30 dB. This eliminates the need for an </p>
<p class="calibre1">automatic gain control (AGC). High sensitivity is also not an issue for DRM. Even very weak </p>

<p class="calibre1">DRM signals of about 10 µV cannot be improved by increasing the overall gain, because the </p>
<p class="calibre1">actual signal to noise ratio is not sufficient with the large bandwidth of 10 kHz. More gain would only raise the noise floor. It has also been shown that the receiver does not require </p>
<p class="calibre1">a tuned preselector. On the one hand, the image frequency at a distance of 910 kHz (2 × </p>
<p class="calibre1">455 kHz) is almost always outside neighboring broadcast bands, and on the other hand, </p>
<p class="calibre1">interfering signals are surprisingly well tolerated by the DRM decoder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The antenna input with an impedance of approximately 50 Ω is directly connected to the di-</p>
<p class="calibre1">ode ring mixer TUF-1, which is designed for a frequency range of 2 to 600 MHz. In practice, </p>
<p class="calibre1">however, the receiver can also work in the medium-wave range down to 500 kHz without </p>
<p class="calibre1">any problems. If an active antenna or a low-impedance preamplifier is used, successful </p>
<p class="calibre1">operation can also be achieved in the long-wave range. At the output of the ring mixer, a </p>
<p class="calibre1">broadband matching network is used for 455 kHz. The impedance is raised by a resonant </p>
<p class="calibre1">circuit with capacitive tapping to approximately 1.5 kΩ to match the input resistance of the ceramic filter CFW455F. The circuit is operated with a low  <i class="calibre4">Q</i>-factor (&lt;10), which results in a bandwidth of approximately 50 kHz and avoids component tolerance issues. The matching </p>
<p class="calibre1">circuit also contributes to the remote signal rejection of the IF filter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The filter CFW455F has a bandwidth of 12 kHz, of which 10 kHz are required for DRM. The </p>
<p class="calibre1">additional bandwidth is not detrimental in fact, having a slightly wider bandwidth is important to handle certain frequency deviations of the second oscillator. If the second oscillator is not exactly at 467 kHz but, for example, at 467.5 kHz, the first IF shifts to 455.5 kHz. The software then has to tune the first oscillator 500 Hz higher. In the end, however, a signal </p>
<p class="calibre1">of 12 kHz appears as required. The slightly shifted first IF still passes through the IF filter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This made it possible to avoid an expensive special crystal in the second oscillator. Instead, the second oscillator at 467 kHz uses an inexpensive ceramic resonator type CSB470. The </p>
<p class="calibre1">frequency is pulled down by 3 kHz due to the large capacitance of the oscillator and reaches a maximum deviation of about 1 kHz. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After the IF filter, there is a single unregulated amplifier stage that raises the signal level by about 20 dB. Since there is no pre-amplification or mixing amplification and the IF filter causes additional signal attenuation, the signal levels are sufficiently small to safely avoid overloading. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A passive FET mixer converts the signal to 12 kHz. The JFET BF245 works like an RF switch </p>
<p class="calibre1">shorting the signal in sync with the oscillator. This simple mixer has a large dynamic range and processes signals up to over 100 mV without noticeable distortion. The subsequent </p>
<p class="calibre1">audio amplifier with the dual op-amp LM358 raises the level by about 20 dB again and </p>
<p class="calibre1">contains a simple bandpass filter </p>

<p class="calibre1">An IQ mixer is a double mixer with a 90 degrees phase difference between the two oscil-</p>
<p class="calibre1">lator signals. This makes it possible to suppress unwanted image frequencies and reduce </p>
<p class="calibre1">the need for complex pre-selection measures for the received signal. This is an essential </p>
<p class="calibre1">principle of most SDR concepts. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">8.1 SDRadio</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Back in the day, it was only high-end world receivers that came with features like a flat </p>
<p class="calibre1">screen display, a wide range of selectable receive bands, and similar luxuries. More recently however, more and more of a receiver’s functions are off loaded into software, while the </p>
<p class="calibre1">hardware becomes ever more Spartan. This trend has resulted in a concept called 'Software </p>
<p class="calibre1">Defined Radio’ (SDR) and is especially relevant in amateur radio. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Figure 8.1: The SDRadio GUI. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">One of the first and simplest programs for working with SDRadio was created by Italian </p>
<p class="calibre1">amateur radio operator Alberto, I2PHD. This PC program, together with a sound card and </p>
<p class="calibre1">a simple IQ mixer as an HF frontend, creates an excellent shortwave receiver working in all </p>
<p class="calibre1">modes from AM to SSB. Without having to retune the receiver, a range up to 48 kHz can </p>
<p class="calibre1">be tuned solely with the mouse. You can always see what is happening on the neighboring </p>
<p class="calibre1">frequencies and can flexibly respond to interference by adjusting the receiver bandwidth, </p>
<p class="calibre1">for example. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The required hardware is an IQ mixer, essentially a direct mixer in the form of a two-stage </p>
<p class="calibre1">mixer with phase-shifted oscillator signals. This effectively achieves the suppression of </p>
<p class="calibre1">image frequencies. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">8.2 Image Frequency Rejection</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Every simple mixer generates, in addition to the desired frequency, a signal at the image </p>
<p class="calibre1">frequency, which often requires a lot of effort to filter out. The I/Q mixer, on the other </p>
<p class="calibre1">hand, consists of two mixing stages and provides its own image frequency suppression. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This principle can be used for very simple receivers and is particularly useful in the context of software-based receivers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The most commonly used types of receivers are the direct conversion receiver, the su-</p>
<p class="calibre1">perheterodyne receiver, and the direct mixer receiver. With a direct conversion receiver, </p>
<p class="calibre1">a resonant circuit at the input provides the only method to select a particular station. An </p>
<p class="calibre1">example is the regenerative receiver where active regeneration provides the necessary </p>
<p class="calibre1">selectivity. A direct conversion receiver does not suffer from image frequency problems </p>
<p class="calibre1">but has relatively low attenuation of adjacent channels. The superheterodyne receiver, on </p>
<p class="calibre1">the other hand, uses several intermediate frequency circuits to achieve good selectivity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, now the image frequency comes into play. A superheterodyne with an interme-</p>
<p class="calibre1">diate frequency of 455 kHz has a secondary reception point at a distance of 2 × 455 kHz </p>
<p class="calibre1">= 910 kHz. On medium wave, a pre-selector is sufficient to suppress this unwanted signal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Many shortwave receivers, however, actually show a significant image frequency. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The direct mixer is a particularly simple receiver that can, for example, produce good </p>
<p class="calibre1">results for anyone starting out in amateur radio. Without going through an intermediate </p>
<p class="calibre1">frequency, it mixes the received signal with a local oscillator running at a frequency very </p>
<p class="calibre1">close to the received signal to directly produce the baseband signal. The principle has also been successfully used for very simple DRM receivers, where the 'AF signal’ is actually a </p>
<p class="calibre1">12 kHz intermediate frequency. In both cases, the image frequency is so close to the target </p>
<p class="calibre1">frequency there is no chance of filtering it out. Figure 8.2 illustrates the problem with an example. A signal at 3990 kHz is to be downmixed to 12 kHz. The mixer oscillator operates </p>
<p class="calibre1">at 3990 kHz + 12 kHz = 4002 kHz. This creates the image frequency of 4002 kHz + 12 kHz </p>
<p class="calibre1">= 4014 kHz. Now you have to hope there is no strong signal on this 'wrong’ frequency. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Figure 8.2: Image frequency generation. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">An I/Q mixer solves the problem of the unwanted spurious frequency by using the con-</p>
<p class="calibre1">cept of quadrature signals. Two identical mixers are used here, which use the same local </p>
<p class="calibre1">oscillator signal, but with a phase difference of 90 degrees. The RF received signal is now </p>
<p class="calibre1">mixed with the two LO signals to produce an I (in-phase) and Q (phase shifted) output. The </p>
<p class="calibre1">signals must now be phase-shifted again and then sent to an adder. Here, the image fre-</p>
<p class="calibre1">quencies will cancel each other out, while the desired signal will be amplified. The reverse </p>

<p class="calibre1">procedure is used to generate SSB signals (Figure 8.3). The same job is performed here: </p>
<p class="calibre1">mixing without an image frequency, which in this case corresponds to the other sideband. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The technique is known as the 'phasing method’ in amateur radio circles. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Figure 8.3: SSB signal generation using the phasing method. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The difficulty with the phasing method, however, is to uniformly rotate an entire frequency </p>
<p class="calibre1">band from 300 to 3000 Hz in phase. In the so-called 'third method’ using the 'Weaver mod-</p>
<p class="calibre1">ulation’ method, two additional mixers are used, which also receive phase-shifted oscillator signals to recover the audio signal. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Figure 8.4: Signal processing according to the 'Third Method’. ((Mixer3.gif))</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Nowadays, the conditions for using an I/Q mixer have become even more favorable be-</p>
<p class="calibre1">cause signal processing via software has made tremendous progress. For simple experi-</p>
<p class="calibre1">ments, there are excellent programs like SDRadio or SDR# available. All you need to do is </p>
<p class="calibre1">provide two signals mixed with a 90-degree phase difference to the left and right channels </p>

<p class="calibre1">The 2.2 nF capacitors at the outputs of the analogue switches provide a low-pass cutoff </p>
<p class="calibre1">frequency well above the band limit of 24 kHz, which ensures that passband tolerances do </p>
<p class="calibre1">not cause additional phase shifts. These simple low-pass filters are only used to isolate high level RF signals from the operational amplifiers. The actual filtering is left to the anti-alias-ing filter in the PC sound card. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Figure 8.13: Mixer without carrier. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The circuit achieves a good image rejection of more than 40 dB. The high overall gain of </p>
<p class="calibre1">about 40 dB is effective for picking up weak signals, but for extremely strong radio stations an antenna attenuator may be required. A weakness of the circuit is the low upper cut-off </p>
<p class="calibre1">frequency. Above about 12 MHz, sensitivity drops sharply. An experiment showed that the </p>
<p class="calibre1">two 1 kΩ resistors in front of the mixers are the source of the problem. If both are replaced by shorts, sensitivity is maintained above 25 MHz but this slightly reduces the image frequency rejection. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although the circuit works relatively well, there is still room for improvement. The following detailed circuit diagram shows the differential amplifier used. It can be seen that this stage is actually not completely symmetrical. This means that the differential amplifier does not </p>

<p class="calibre1">The problem here is in the different input resistance of the two inputs, even though the </p>

<p class="calibre1">a voltage divider to ground with no negative feedback. The upper 1 kΩ resistor is between </p>
<p class="calibre1">+1 V and -1 V, resulting in an input impedance of only 0.5 kΩ. This violates the most im-</p>
<p class="calibre1">portant rule of IQ circuit technology, which is that all four phases should be equally loaded. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Figure 8.16: Unsymmetrical input impedance. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">There is a possible solution in the form of the so-called 'instrumentation amplifier’. For </p>

<p class="calibre1">longer be almost zero. A fully compensated operational amplifier has to struggle to follow </p>
<p class="calibre1">the input voltage. At higher frequencies, distortion occurs. Signals above 20 kHz can be </p>
<p class="calibre1">present at the mixer output, and their distortion products may partly lie in the passband. </p>
<p class="calibre1">These considerations led to the decision to reject the instrumentation amplifier for this </p>
<p class="calibre1">application. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The experiments have clearly shown that the symmetrical input resistance of the circuit is </p>
<p class="calibre1">more important than a high common-mode rejection ratio. If the RF input circuit operates </p>
<p class="calibre1">very linearly and a high-pass filter of 24 kHz is also used, there are actually no problems </p>
<p class="calibre1">with IF breakthrough. So, you returned to the original circuit using slightly different values. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The effective input resistance is now about 5 kΩ at both inputs. A series resistor of 100 Ω </p>
<p class="calibre1">offers a good compromise between high RF cutoff frequency and good decoupling between </p>
<p class="calibre1">I and Q mixers. In addition, the TL084 is now used, which is not quite as noise-free but has a gain bandwidth product of 4 MHz and can run from a simple 5 V supply voltage. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Figure 8.18: Now with matched input impedances. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The overall circuit is not optimized for highest sensitivity, but rather for high immunity to large signals and low distortion even with strong radio signals, including strong DRM stations. An SNR of well over 30 dB has been observed using this setup. The high sensitivity </p>
<p class="calibre1">typically found in amateur radio receiver specifications is not achieved here. Selective preamplifiers can however be used to address these requirements as well. </p>

<p class="calibre1">A Software Defined Radio (SDR) requires little hardware but sophisticated software. This </p>
<p class="calibre1">SDR project aimed to show what is achievable with minimal effort. The goal was to create </p>

<p class="calibre1">but also allowing reception of amateur radio bands. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Radio Builder's Book</p>
<p class="calibre1">The objective of this project was to create a receiver with medium sensitivity, but with the highest linearity and phase purity. The development focused on properties that are important for a top-notch DRM receiver. In fact, the receiver achieves an excellent signal to noise performance. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Figure 8.27: The Elektor Software Defined Radio with USB port. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Regarding sensitivity and overload resistance, the receiver can’t compete with top of the </p>
<p class="calibre1">range amateur radio equipment. Experiments have however shown that on the lower bands </p>
<p class="calibre1">up to 20 meters, the atmospheric noise is usually so strong that greater sensitivity is not </p>
<p class="calibre1">really an advantage. A comparison with an older Yaesu FT-7B rig showed about the same </p>
<p class="calibre1">results when receiving CW and SSB stations on the 80, 40, and 20-meter bands using the </p>
<p class="calibre1">same antenna. However, the SDR scored points with its advanced software capabilities. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Features such as continuously adjustable bandwidth and spectrum display are otherwise </p>
<p class="calibre1">only available in much more expensive receivers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The receiver is controlled via USB from where it also sources its power. No additional power supply is needed. The FT232R was chosen as the USB interface. This modern USB-to-serial </p>
<p class="calibre1">converter does not require a quartz crystal because it has an internal high-precision RC </p>
<p class="calibre1">oscillator. The component is used here in its bit-bang mode, like a fast parallel port. Eight data lines are available and can be controlled as desired. Two of the signals are used as I²C </p>
<p class="calibre1">bus to control the receiver frequency. Three signals are used to switch the input multiplexer to select one of eight antenna inputs with and without filters. Two more inputs are used to </p>
<p class="calibre1">switch the receiver’s IF amplifier gain. This control interface ensures the receiver can be </p>
<p class="calibre1">fully managed via software. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Special attention was paid to decoupling the power supply. One of the reasons for this is </p>
<p class="calibre1">that the FT232RL USB chip uses internal clock signals which are at frequencies that will </p>
<p class="calibre1">also be received via the antenna. You don’t want any of this unwanted RF noise to leak </p>
<p class="calibre1">across from one stage to another. The FT232R contains exactly what the programmable </p>
<p class="calibre1">clock generator CY27EE16 needs with a voltage regulator of 3.3 V. Therefore, no addition-</p>
<p class="calibre1">al voltage regulator is needed. The remaining part of the circuit operates at 5 V, several </p>
<p class="calibre1">supplies are provided to power specific functions on the board with appropriate decoupling </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p136"></a>Radio Builder's Book</p>
<p class="calibre1">to reduce crosstalk and noise. Keep in mind that the 5 V from the USB ultimately comes </p>
<p class="calibre1">from a PC power supply. The same power supply powers the entire PC, and load changes </p>
<p class="calibre1">can cause some noise on the supply line. This is particularly critical for the RF preamplifier of the receiver, which ultimately couples via the mixers to the IF branch. Therefore, a large capacitor provides stability at this point (VCC_HF). </p>
<p class="calibre1">The SDR requires an oscillator frequency that is four times higher than the signal received </p>
<p class="calibre1">so that it can be divided by four with the required phase shift. If you are aiming to receive signals up to 30 MHz, the oscillator needs to run up to 120 MHz. DDS oscillators are often </p>
<p class="calibre1">used in advanced RF projects but a DDS able to run at this speed will work out expensive, </p>
<p class="calibre1">power-hungry, and difficult to control. For this reason a programmable clock oscillator with an internal PLL is used here. Although the CY27EE16 was originally designed as a clock </p>
<p class="calibre1">oscillator for digital electronics and processors, it has proven itself in many RF applications. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although the achievable frequency resolution is not as good as a DDS, the relatively modest </p>
<p class="calibre1">power consumption is important for this project, as you cannot draw too much power from </p>
<p class="calibre1">the standard USB port. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The chip is programmed via the I²C bus using the SCL and SDA lines. A VCO operates in-</p>
<p class="calibre1">ternally in the frequency range of 100 to 400 MHz. The VCO is stabilized using a 10 MHz </p>
<p class="calibre1">crystal and a PLL. Its output signal is passed via dividers to reach the desired outputs. The clock output Clock5 was chosen here. There is a VFO signal between 600 kHz and 120 MHz </p>
<p class="calibre1">that passes to the 74AC74 chain of dividers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The exact phase shift of 90 degrees between the two oscillator signals is important. Devi-</p>
<p class="calibre1">ations lead to less effective suppression of image frequencies. Since the divider 74AC74 is </p>
<p class="calibre1">connected as a synchronous divider, you would not expect to find any phase error here. In </p>
<p class="calibre1">fact, the receiver shows a constant mirror suppression of about 40 dB up to about 15 MHz. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From about 20 MHz, this value decreases noticeably, but this is tolerable due to the lower </p>
<p class="calibre1">occupancy in this frequency range. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The receiver has several inputs that are switched via the input multiplexer 74HC4051. The </p>
<p class="calibre1">antenna input Ant1 is fed by way of filters to the first three inputs. The first switch position (wide) uses only an input choke, to short any low-frequency signals at the input to ground. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the second position (medium wave), there is a low-pass filter with a cut-off frequency of 1.6 MHz, where the resistor R12 dampens a resonance peak. This filter prevents medium </p>
<p class="calibre1">wave reception from being disturbed by harmonic mixing with stations in the shortwave </p>
<p class="calibre1">range. The third position uses a simple RC high-pass filter, which is intended to attenuate </p>
<p class="calibre1">strong medium wave signals. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another input (PC1) can be selected if you wish to connect external tuned input circuits or </p>
<p class="calibre1">preamplifiers. Three more inputs are provided for future expansion. The input filters on the board can be regarded as a kind of basic equipment that is sufficient in most cases. However, it would be possible to add further steep low-pass filters or special band-pass filters, which would safely attenuate harmonic mixing components in all situations. </p>

<p class="calibre1">From the input multiplexer, the RF signal goes to a BF245C JFET which functions as an im-</p>
<p class="calibre1">pedance converter. The input is relatively high-impedance at 100 kohms, so, for example, a </p>
<p class="calibre1">high-Q resonant circuit can also be connected to the input In2. At the low-impedance out-</p>
<p class="calibre1">put of the source follower, a voltage of about 2.5 V is established, which is passed through the mixers and the following operational amplifiers to the output. Therefore, it is important that there are no low-frequency signal residues at the source. For example, the purity of </p>
<p class="calibre1">the supply voltage Vcc_HF is critical and therefore has a high level of filtering. The FET itself provides additional decoupling of the supply voltage. But nothing should come from its gate </p>
<p class="calibre1">that reaches the IF range below 24 kHz. For this reason an RF choke is placed directly at </p>
<p class="calibre1">the antenna input to shunt any 50 Hz (60 Hz) hum signals, for example. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The IF amplifier consists of two exactly equal branches, each of which provides a total gain of up to 40 dB. The TL084 was chosen here because it has a good gain-bandwidth product </p>
<p class="calibre1">of 10 MHz at a supply voltage of 5 V. This is important in order to supply a gain of 10 without phase errors to signals at around 20 kHz. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The final stage has a gain of 10 (20 dB), but this can be reduced to unity gain via the analog switches. A total of three attenuation steps are available: 0 dB, -10 dB, and -20 dB. So, </p>
<p class="calibre1">if excessively strong signals lead to overload, the gain can be reduced by software. The </p>
<p class="calibre1">attenuator is not located at the input of the receiver because there is already high over-</p>
<p class="calibre1">load resistance built in. On the other hand, at full gain, with a long antenna and high field strengths, the output can be over driven. The attenuation therefore applies to the output </p>
<p class="calibre1">driver stage and corresponds approximately to the gain control in an IF amplifier. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 9 • Shortwave Antenna Design</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">When starting out building a simple crystal radio or an SDR receiver, it’s often enough to </p>
<p class="calibre1">use a simple stick antenna or even a test lead on the lab bench to act as the aerial. For </p>
<p class="calibre1">better reception try something like a 5 m length of wire hung around the room or even </p>
<p class="calibre1">just resting on the floor. However, with this type of layout, the antenna will also pick up </p>
<p class="calibre1">any background electrical noise from domestic appliances and interference from the mains </p>
<p class="calibre1">power network. For indoor use, antennas sensitive to the magnetic field have proven to be </p>
<p class="calibre1">more effective. With a good outdoor antenna, especially on shortwave, you can achieve so </p>
<p class="calibre1">much more. The special appeal of listening in to the shortwave bands lies in the chance of </p>
<p class="calibre1">picking up broadcasts from great distances (DX reception) thanks to sky bounce. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">9.1 Radio Wave Propagation</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">In the VHF radio frequency band, radio waves behave similar to light waves and this qua-</p>
<p class="calibre1">si-optical propagation pattern limits their reception range to about 100 km depending on </p>
<p class="calibre1">antenna height. However, radio waves below 30 MHz behave completely differently and </p>
<p class="calibre1">allow for a much greater range. Nevertheless, the complex propagation mechanisms in this </p>
<p class="calibre1">range also lead to special problems such as dependence on the time of day, fluctuating field strength (fading) and selective fading. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The crucial role in the propagation of shortwave radio signals is played by ionized, weakly </p>
<p class="calibre1">conducting layers of air in the upper atmosphere, created by solar particle and gamma </p>
<p class="calibre1">radiation that ionize the air molecules, stripping electrons from them. These free electrons act like a mirror to certain frequency bands and under certain RF wave angles of incidence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The ionosphere is, however, transparent to high angles of incidence and high frequencies. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Figure 9.1: Skywave and dead zones affecting shortwave propagation. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">In shortwave radio communication, the range of a transmitter can be limited to about 30 </p>
<p class="calibre1">to 100 km by ground wave propagation, depending on the height of the antenna. Beyond </p>
<p class="calibre1">this distance, the signal disappears over the horizon and direct line of sight communication is not possible. However, at a certain minimum distance, waves reflected by the ionosphere </p>
<p class="calibre1">can reach the receiver (skywave propagation). There is a dead zone between the ground </p>
<p class="calibre1">wave range and the reflected wave range, where neither wave can be received. This dead </p>
<p class="calibre1">zone varies for each frequency and depends on the time of day and level of solar activity. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Radio Builder's Book</p>
<p class="calibre1">Higher frequencies allow for a flatter reflection, resulting in longer ranges. A dead zone is therefore larger and extends up to about 200 km at 6 MHz and up to about 1000 km at </p>
<p class="calibre1">15 MHz during the day. At night, dead zones expand and the range increases. This can </p>
<p class="calibre1">lead to a situation where a specific transmitter is heard clearly in the evening, but suddenly drops out, having entered a dead zone. Listeners may be able to overcome this by switching to a lower frequency band if the same program is broadcast on multiple bands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Most of the time, radio waves reach the receiver through multiple paths. These paths </p>
<p class="calibre1">have different lengths, causing phase differences that can result in partial amplification </p>
<p class="calibre1">or cancellation of the signal. In the shortwave range, field strength can fluctuate rapidly, leading to selective fading, which can cause unpleasant distortion in AM radio broadcasts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, DRM (digital radio mondiale) is more robust against partial data loss caused by </p>
<p class="calibre1">fading. Despite the deep notches in the DRM spectrum caused by the cancellation of certain </p>
<p class="calibre1">frequencies, the reception is usually not disturbed thanks to effective error correction. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Figure 9.2:  Selective Fading. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">9.2 The Longwire Antenna</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">If you are only interested in listening to strong local shortwave broadcasts all that’s necessary is a short whip antenna less than a meter in length. Under favorable conditions, you </p>
<p class="calibre1">can test this on the bench by using a length of cable as the antenna. For long-distance (DX) reception however, a long wire antenna outside the house in free space is a better bet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">More important than the shape of the antenna is its elevated position far enough away from </p>
<p class="calibre1">houses to avoid domestic electrical interference. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Suspended long wire antennas are a good solution for shortwave reception. In theory, </p>
<p class="calibre1">resonance occurs at a quarter wavelength of the received radio signal; a good ground wire </p>
<p class="calibre1">to the antenna can help to reduce the effects of unwanted noise and interference and can </p>
<p class="calibre1">also improve the antenna’s efficiency by providing a more stable and consistent ground </p>
<p class="calibre1">reference. In practice, wire antennas of around 10 meters in length usually give good re-</p>
<p class="calibre1">sults. If the receiver is close to a window or an outer wall of your house, all you need is to connect the end of the antenna directly to the center pole of the coaxial aerial connector </p>
<p class="calibre1">of your receiver. If the antenna feed needs to travel a longer distance inside the house, a </p>
<p class="calibre1">coaxial cable should be used, and a ground connection should be made near the antenna </p>
<p class="calibre1">feed point. It doesn’t matter whether a 50-ohm or 75-ohm cable is used since the antenna </p>

<p class="calibre1">Chapter 9 • Shortwave Antenna Design</p>
<p class="calibre1">has a variable characteristic impedance depending on the receive frequency and a complex </p>
<p class="calibre1">impedance with varying capacitive and inductive components. The length of coax also has </p>
<p class="calibre1">its own resonances which affect the overall antenna impedance, so that other resonances </p>
<p class="calibre1">can occur outside those predicted by the antenna length itself. However, this is barely no-</p>
<p class="calibre1">ticeable at the receiver because signal differences of around 10 dB are hardly significant. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Figure 9.3: A longwire antenna using a coaxial cable feed. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">When planning a longwire antenna, it’s common to use copper wire with a decent sized </p>
<p class="calibre1">cross-section to achieve both good mechanical stability and low ohmic losses. A good op-</p>
<p class="calibre1">tion is to use the type of cable used for standard mains wiring with a cross-section of </p>
<p class="calibre1">0.75 mm² to 1.5 mm², but thinner wires can also be used. For example, a test with thin </p>
<p class="calibre1">coil wire with a diameter of only 0.3 mm produced usable results when stretched about 10 </p>
<p class="calibre1">meters outdoors and then another 10 meters inside an apartment. Indoors it was rigged </p>
<p class="calibre1">above head height to remain reasonably inconspicuous. The additional section running </p>
<p class="calibre1">inside the building picks up local interference and adds some additional signal attenuation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite this, a usable makeshift antenna was created and remained unnoticed and almost </p>
<p class="calibre1">invisible while still pulling in far flung stations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If building your own antenna seems daunting, you might be able to reuse some existing </p>
<p class="calibre1">installations and cables. A typical rooftop antenna installation delivers not only TV and FM </p>
<p class="calibre1">signals, but also the entire AM range from longwave to shortwave. It’s worth trying to see </p>
<p class="calibre1">what can be received. In many cases, a rooftop antenna provides better results than an </p>
<p class="calibre1">indoor antenna. Often, old antennas are no longer in use, or have been swept off the roof </p>
<p class="calibre1">by a passing gale. In this case, the coax feed may still be in place; just by shorting the </p>
<p class="calibre1">outer shield together with the inner core you now have a useful vertical antenna. The cable </p>
<p class="calibre1">usually leads to the roof of the house, providing greater height than a horizontal longwire </p>
<p class="calibre1">antenna. Better results can be achieved with this set up, especially on higher frequencies </p>
<p class="calibre1">above 15 MHz, than with a longwire antenna. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">9.3 Using a Preselector</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">In many cases, the performance of a receiver can be improved by adding a tuned pre-</p>
<p class="calibre1">selector circuit between the aerial and front end of the receiver. This can often prevent </p>
<p class="calibre1">overload caused by strong nearby signals outside the reception band. Whilst preselection </p>
<p class="calibre1">is not always necessary, it can be a good solution in some specific situations. In amateur </p>
<p class="calibre1">radio or shortwave listening, antenna matching devices are used that provide both optimal </p>
<p class="calibre1">impedance matching and some selectivity. This often results in a significant attenuation of </p>
<p class="calibre1">the unwanted image signal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A simple solution for the 49-meter band is to use a 6.0 MHz ceramic bandpass IF filter type </p>
<p class="calibre1">SFE 6, which was originally used in the audio carrier path of television sets. Although its </p>
<p class="calibre1">nominal -3 dB bandwidth of approximately 100 kHz is somewhat narrow and its 600 ohms </p>
<p class="calibre1">impedance is not optimal, it still works well. The low impedance of the antenna and receiver input flattens the filter response. The –6 dB corner frequencies were measured at 5850 kHz </p>
<p class="calibre1">and 6150 kHz, allowing all the important frequencies in the 49-meter band to pass through. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Figure 9.4 shows the filter at the receiver input. A bypass switch allows for easy comparison of results with and without the filter. Additionally, the receiver can be easily switched to a wider bandwidth when receiving stations outside the 49-meter band. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Figure 9.4: Using a ceramic IF filter. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">To build a preselector for use with the other shortwave bands as well, is best to use an </p>
<p class="calibre1">adjustable resonant circuit. For this you can start by winding an air core coil made up of 20 </p>
<p class="calibre1">turns wound around an 8 mm diameter plastic former. The winding should measure 10 mm </p>
<p class="calibre1">along the length of the former to produce an inductance of 2.5 µH. A tuning capacitor of </p>
<p class="calibre1">320 pF achieves a lower frequency of about 5.6 MHz. Therefore, the 49 m band and higher </p>
<p class="calibre1">bands up to about 16 MHz can be tuned. A tap at the second turn of this coil provides the </p>
<p class="calibre1">appropriate impedance for connection to the receiver input. The antenna can be connected </p>
<p class="calibre1">via a coupling coil made up of two to four turns. If the coupling coil is designed so that it can be shifted along the axis of the first coil then some variable coupling will be possible. This allows you to find the optimal match. A tighter coupling results in a higher signal voltage, but also a lower Q factor and thereby less attenuation of the image frequency. If a short </p>
<p class="calibre1">antenna such as a stick antenna is to be used, the coupling must be arranged more tightly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The antenna can then be connected directly to the hot end of the resonant circuit. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Figure 9.5: An adjustable band pass filter adds preselection. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The resonant circuit has a  <i class="calibre4">Q</i> factor of about 50, which results in a bandwidth of 120 kHz at 6 MHz. Therefore, the tuning capacitor needs to be adjusted quite precisely. If the preselector is housed in a case, it’s a good idea to mark the most important frequencies on a </p>
<p class="calibre1">scale. A typical tuning capacitor has a tuning range of not much more than 1 to 10, includ-</p>
<p class="calibre1">ing all circuit capacitances. This results in a frequency range ratio of 1 to 3. To cover larger frequency bands, multiple coils can be used, and a selector switch can be used to choose </p>
<p class="calibre1">between them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">An alternative solution comes from the world of amateur radio, where the same problem </p>
<p class="calibre1">occurs with the usual amateur radio bands (80 m to 10 m, 3.5 MHz to 29.7 MHz) which </p>
<p class="calibre1">require a preselector with a tuning range of 1 to 10. Here the answer is to use coupled </p>
<p class="calibre1">circuits, which have two tracked resonances. Figure 9.6 shows a proven circuit with a twin </p>
<p class="calibre1">ganged tuning capacitor. Although there are two pass frequencies for each setting, the </p>
<p class="calibre1">"wrong" one is far away from the desired frequency. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Figure 9.6: Tuning from 3 MHz to 30 MHz. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Instead of a variable capacitor, a variable capacitance diode or varicap like the BB112 can </p>
<p class="calibre1">also be used for tuning. It is important to have a stable and well-smoothed tuning voltage, </p>
<p class="calibre1">otherwise phase modulation of the received signals could affect reception. Figure 9.7 shows </p>
<p class="calibre1">a preselector using a BB112 varicap. </p>

<p class="calibre1">A fixed-frequency tuned circuit at the receiver front end may also be a useful solution in </p>
<p class="calibre1">some situations. In the medium-wave band for example, there may be only one usable re-</p>
<p class="calibre1">ception frequency. Even with a relatively large relative bandwidth of the input circuit, good selection is achieved due to the low frequency. The circuit in Figure 9.8 therefore employs a fixed inductor. The fixed-frequency band pass filter used here was designed for 1296 kHz. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">9.4 Tuned Magnetic Field Antennas</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">A long wire antenna receives electrical energy from both the electric and magnetic field </p>
<p class="calibre1">components of the RF field but smaller antennas such as whip antenna are only sensitive to </p>
<p class="calibre1">the electric field component, which results in higher noise in the received signal, especially in domestic environments. Electrical appliances and power line noise couple capacitively </p>
<p class="calibre1">to the receiving antenna, so in this environment it would be advantageous to pick up the </p>
<p class="calibre1">magnetic field component instead. In principle, a wire loop or coil is sufficient for this purpose. A commonly used antenna design for this purpose is a frame antenna onto which a </p>
<p class="calibre1">few turns of wire or simple loops (aka magnetic loops) are wound. Tuned loops with high  <i class="calibre4">Q</i> </p>
<p class="calibre1">are highly effective. For example, a length of copper pipe bent into a one-meter diameter </p>
<p class="calibre1">loop can be used, or a wide length of aluminum foil wrapped around a correspondingly </p>
<p class="calibre1">large cardboard box also produces good results. Tuning the loop with a variable capacitor </p>
<p class="calibre1">up to 500 pF produces a resonant circuit with an extremely high  <i class="calibre4">Q</i>, resulting in significantly more voltage at the antenna than might be expected for an aerial of this size. The receiver </p>
<p class="calibre1">is loosely coupled using a small coupling coil to avoid excessively damping the loop. The </p>
<p class="calibre1">optimal size and location of the coupling coil is best determined experimentally. Thanks to </p>
<p class="calibre1">the high  <i class="calibre4">Q</i> of the antenna, an additional preselector is unnecessary in this design. </p>

<p class="calibre1">A magnetic loop antenna can also be built using simple wire, although this results in lower </p>
<p class="calibre1">Q factor together with lower antenna voltage and a wider bandwidth. If the antenna needs </p>
<p class="calibre1">to be physically smaller, two or more turns of insulated wire can be used. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the simplest case, a shielded loop can be built using a length of coaxial cable. This an-</p>
<p class="calibre1">tenna can be discreetly placed on a bookshelf and provides a relatively good signal-to-noise ratio. The resonance frequency is determined by the size of the loop and the value of the </p>
<p class="calibre1">tuning capacitance. With a total of four meters of coaxial cable and a 500 pF tuning capaci-</p>
<p class="calibre1">tor, resonant frequencies below 6 MHz can be achieved. The broadband transformer should </p>
<p class="calibre1">have a higher value of inductance on the primary inner-wire loop side than on the second-</p>
<p class="calibre1">ary outer-shield loop side. Good results can be achieved with about 20 turns on a ferrite or toroidal core. The tuned circuit should not be overly damped for high quality. Therefore, the secondary side of the transformer should only have two to four turns, the best coupling coil match should be determined experimentally. </p>

<p class="calibre1">netic field (H), their sum produces a single maximum. To produce a distinct minimum for </p>
<p class="calibre1">unwanted signals, the telescopic antenna needs to be adjusted experimentally to balance </p>

<p class="calibre1">The two-stage preamplifier compensates for this signal loss almost completely. The limit </p>
<p class="calibre1">to the maximum preamplifier gain setting is when you begin to hear the noise generated </p>
<p class="calibre1">by the first transistor in the preamp stage. However, this is not yet the case, especially in the shortwave band, i.e., atmospheric noise prevails despite the small antenna. A second </p>
<p class="calibre1">limit of amplification arises due to the possible occurrence of intermodulation from strong </p>
<p class="calibre1">signals. With three stages, strong overloading of the final transistor and clear intermodu-</p>
<p class="calibre1">lation products can occur. You can recognize this condition when there are practically no </p>

<p class="calibre1">however works quite well with this size of antenna. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Both stages use feedback to adjust the operating point and reduce distortion. The input </p>

<p class="calibre1">Typically, an SDR receiver is designed for long antennas and will not overload even with the higher signal levels of a long wire antenna. However, it’s worth testing to see if a short whip antenna will do the job also. For this purpose, a small preamplifier is required. The following circuit works across the entire shortwave range. The antenna used here is only 30 cm long </p>
<p class="calibre1">and consists of 0.5 mm diameter single strand wire. The recovered signal levels were com-</p>
<p class="calibre1">parable to those of the long wire antenna but interference from domestic appliances was </p>
<p class="calibre1">more apparent so that the noise floor was worse, resulting in more dropouts. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Figure 9.14: Preamplifier for short antennas. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">In the medium-wave range, a ferrite rod antenna works well as they are relatively insensi-</p>
<p class="calibre1">tive to electrical interference, similar to magnetic loops. Figure 9.15 shows a ferrite anten-na with an impedance converter. The resonant circuit generates relatively high resonance </p>
<p class="calibre1">signals, even from distant transmitters. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Listening to distant shortwave broadcasts can be exciting and a real challenge, but most </p>
<p class="calibre1">people who simply want to listen to music or current affairs end up using an FM radio on </p>
<p class="calibre1">the more common VHF frequency band. This type of radio that sits on the kitchen worktop </p>
<p class="calibre1">is fairly ubiquitous. It’s easy to forget that you could fairly easily build one of them from scratch. In this article, we will look at some tried and tested designs that will help you make your own FM radio. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">10.1 A Superregenerative Receiver</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The simplest FM radio receiver circuit is the superregenerative (superregen) receiver. You </p>
<p class="calibre1">can build such a receiver with just two transistors. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Figure 10.1: A 2 transistor superregenerative receiver. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">To ensure stable operation, a large ground plane is necessary for this design. To build this experimental setup in the lab I used a cut-out tin lid of a coffee can. These sorts of cans </p>
<p class="calibre1">are often used to package dry edible goods; they normally have a cardboard tube crimped </p>
<p class="calibre1">onto a thin circular tin-plate base. For our purposes the cardboard can be cut away with a </p>
<p class="calibre1">sharp knife. The lid here is slightly domed and provides a stable base which takes solder </p>
<p class="calibre1">very well. A piece of perforated or strip board is used as a wiring field. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The tuning coil can be made of copper wire or, better still, silver-plated copper wire with a gauge of 0.8 mm winding 5 turns on an 8 mm diameter former. Keep the interconnections </p>
<p class="calibre1">short, especially to the tuning capacitor. The tuning capacitor used here is a trimmer ca-</p>
<p class="calibre1">pacitor mounted directly on the ground plane. The second coil in the circuit has 20 turns of 0.2 mm CuL wound directly on the body of a quarter-watt, 10 kΩ resistor. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Figure 10.2: Circuit build using a tinplated earth plane. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The antenna should not be too long to avoid interfering with other radio listeners via the </p>
<p class="calibre1">regeneration process. The circuit is very sensitive and works with a 10 cm long antenna </p>
<p class="calibre1">made simply from a piece of wire. The headphone should ideally be a 400 Ω high-imped-</p>
<p class="calibre1">ance type. A 32 Ω stereo headphone will also work but may be relatively quiet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At turn on the receiver initially makes a loud noise. You can use a screwdriver on the coil </p>
<p class="calibre1">slug to adjust the frequency and when you find an FM station, the noise becomes quieter or </p>
<p class="calibre1">completely silent. To hear the FM signal clearly, you need to tune in precisely. This requires some practice and skill but once you’ve found your favorite station on FM, you don’t need </p>
<p class="calibre1">to touch the dial again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The sound quality of this simple receiver is admittedly rather poor. But at least it works </p>
<p class="calibre1">with just two transistors. In the early days of FM radio, the superregen design was widely </p>
<p class="calibre1">used. Back then, the circuit was built using vacuum tubes. This design, however, eventually </p>
<p class="calibre1">fell into disrepute because it simultaneously receives and transmits and can interfere with </p>
<p class="calibre1">your neighbors listening pleasure. This also applies to the version of this receiver built here. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It is doubtful that you would get the CE stamp of conformity for such a radio. The whole </p>
<p class="calibre1">thing is more of an interesting experiment rather than a suggested replacement for the </p>
<p class="calibre1">proven superhet. On the other hand, you often find the superregen principle still used in </p>
<p class="calibre1">receivers working in simple remote control receivers, radio-controlled sockets, and wireless thermometers. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The quench oscillator is just a normal oscillator. Every time the oscillator output releases the tuned VHF circuit, oscillations start building up beginning from almost zero. Thermal </p>
<p class="calibre1">noise in the front end helps initiate the tuned circuit oscillation. This stimulation effect sometimes works faster and sometimes more slowly. The individual build-up process therefore takes different lengths of time, which leads to an increase in collector current noise </p>
<p class="calibre1">overall. This noise is audible in a superregen receiver when it is not tuned to any station. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The waveform shown in <b class="calibre3">Figure 10.4</b> triggers on the first left-most edge; noise on the </p>
<p class="calibre1">waveform can be seen as increasing fuzzyness as the trace moves across to the right side </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Bild 10.4: Quench waveform with noise. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">When a received signal is present at the set frequency, this helps to initiate the next envelope of RF oscillations. So it starts a little faster every time. The quenching frequency will therefore increase when receiving a signal. An unmodulated receive signal will produce a </p>
<p class="calibre1">stable quenching oscillation with no noise at the output. An amplitude modulated signal will provide differing levels of oscillator start up assistance, which will be reflected in the average value of the change in collector current. An FM signal can be demodulated by tuning </p>

<p class="calibre1">types of modulation can be accommodated. The resulting waveforms can be viewed on an </p>
<p class="calibre1">oscilloscope. A Sawtooth waveform at the emitter resistor indicates when a station is being </p>
<p class="calibre1">received. The sensitivity of this receiver is so good it can actually work without an antenna! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The RF resonant circuit on its own absorbs enough energy for operation. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">10.2 Vacuum Tube Super Regen Receiver</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The Franzis tube radio (Section 3.9) is a shortwave regenerative receiver. Such circuits </p>
<p class="calibre1">will burst into oscillation (motor boating) if the feedback control is turned up too far at </p>
<p class="calibre1">higher frequencies. An experiment was carried out to find out whether the radio could be </p>
<p class="calibre1">converted into a VHF superregen receiver, thereby removing the need for manual feedback </p>
<p class="calibre1">tweaking. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Figure 10.5: VHF superregen with a 6J1. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">In the first test, I removed the shortwave coil and replaced it with a smaller three turn </p>
<p class="calibre1">coil more suitable for use in the VHF band. Connections to the tuning capacitor are also </p>
<p class="calibre1">changed, so that the 20 pF range is now used. Instead of the feedback adjustment potenti-</p>
<p class="calibre1">ometer I connected a 0 to 60 V power supply. The 100 kΩ grid resistor no longer connects </p>
<p class="calibre1">to the anode, because that would cause negative feedback and dampen oscillations. Now it </p>
<p class="calibre1">connects to +6 V at the heater. Some regeneration oscillations could already be observed, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but at too low a frequency. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Figure 10.6: The 3-turn VHF coil. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The long tracks on the circuit board were causing a problem. I wound an improved coil us-</p>
<p class="calibre1">ing thicker wire made up of three turns using the shank of an 8 mm drill bit as a former and soldered the coil very close to the tuning capacitor. The tap point to the cathode is made </p>
<p class="calibre1">with a short wire, and the grid is connected to the 100 pF capacitor using short leads. The </p>
<p class="calibre1">tracks at the grid and cathode are also cut. Now with all these changes made I was then </p>
<p class="calibre1">able to tune the radio across the entire FM band. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When measuring with the oscilloscope, I saw strong evidence of the quenching oscillation </p>
<p class="calibre1">signal at the collector of the AF preamp. For this reason I soldered a 100 nF capacitor </p>
<p class="calibre1">between the collector and emitter of transistor T2 (see Figure 10.5). For the preliminary </p>
<p class="calibre1">testing I just soldered a 470 kΩ resistor between P4 and P5 instead of the volume pot. With </p>
<p class="calibre1">these changes, the FM radio worked. I need to supply the anode voltage between 30 and </p>
<p class="calibre1">40 V from a lab power supply. The circuit will not function on 15 V alone like the shortwave version of the radio does. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">10.3 VHF Receiver using the TDA7088</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">This FM radio from Franzis can receive stations in the range of 87.5 MHz to 108 MHz and </p>
<p class="calibre1">provides good reception quality. Thanks to the TDA7088 integrated receiver module, you </p>
<p class="calibre1">can listen to strong local stations with good sound quality. The receiver’s sensitivity is also good enough to pull in distant stations. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The design of this radio set is reminiscent of portable radios from the 1960s. Back in those days semiconductor devices were replacing vacuum tubes in more and more applications. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Transistors consumed less energy and allowed devices like radio sets to be made smaller, </p>
<p class="calibre1">battery powered and portable. Apart from that, the principles of a radio receiver design </p>
<p class="calibre1">were very similar to that of older tube radios. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Radio Builder's Book</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thanks to the highly integrated nature of the TDA7088 receiver IC, building your own FM </p>
<p class="calibre1">radio is now very easy. The single-ended audio amplifier function is more similar to the historical predecessor of a tube radio. The vintage radio uses a two-stage transistor amplifier and gives a moderate output volume powered from two AA cells which will last for up to </p>
<p class="calibre1">200 hours. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Figure 10.9: The kit components. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Most FM superheterodyne receivers use an intermediate frequency of 10.7 MHz. The re-</p>
<p class="calibre1">ceived frequency is first converted to the intermediate frequency and then filtered, ampli-</p>
<p class="calibre1">fied, and demodulated. This FM radio is also a superhet that converts its received signal to an intermediate frequency. However, the intermediate frequency is much lower at about </p>
<p class="calibre1">70 kHz. This means that the IF filters do not require matched coils. The FM demodulator is </p>
<p class="calibre1">simplified and much more immune to distortion. All the essential stages are included in a </p>
<p class="calibre1">single SMD IC, the 16-pin TDA7088. Instead of an air-vaned tuning capacitor like you see </p>
<p class="calibre1">in older radio receivers, this radio uses a varactor or varicap diode D1. As the DC voltage </p>
<p class="calibre1">across the diode increases its depletion zone becomes wider and its capacitance value de-</p>
<p class="calibre1">creases. This translates into a higher receive frequency. The only adjustment point is the </p>
<p class="calibre1">coil SP1, which sets the oscillator frequency lower limit. </p>

<p class="calibre1">This radio has a special feature called the 'sound switch’. When you turn it on, it activates the tube and gives the radio a fuller sound. If you just want to casually listen to the news, you can turn off this tube and save power. The sound switch interrupts the tube’s heating </p>
<p class="calibre1">circuit. When the heater is off, anode current flow will stop. Part of the audio signal is then directed past the tube to the final amplifier. With an active tube, you get more volume and </p>

<p class="calibre1">the SI4735 contains a digital signal processor (DSP) which takes care of these tasks. A </p>
<p class="calibre1">PC or microcontroller is, however, still required for tuning. The SI4735 has various digital interfaces for communication, and in this case, the I2C bus is used. This uses signals SDA </p>
<p class="calibre1">and SCL along with the chip’s reset input. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The circuit diagram shows a minimal setup for the initial test. Only a short piece of wire </p>
<p class="calibre1">was used as an FM antenna. The stereo outputs R and L do not have coupling capacitors </p>
<p class="calibre1">because they are already included in the internal amplifier input. A 32 kHz crystal provides the clock signal. The interface to the UM232R requires three resistors. Two of the lines could be connected directly, but this provides greater fault tolerance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The chip requires a supply voltage of 3.3 V at VDD and VIO. Note that no more than 3.6 V </p>
<p class="calibre1">is allowed at VDD. It is important to make sure that the UM232R interface adapter is not ac-</p>
<p class="calibre1">cidentally jumpered to 5 V. Unfortunately one chip was damaged during the initial trials due to my own carelessness. Jumper S1 must be in the upper position to provide 3.3 V to VIO. </p>

<p class="calibre1">stations are distributed around a rotation angle of 270 degrees. The user would typically </p>
<p class="calibre1">only listen to just a few of these stations. Say for example three stations are programmed </p>
<p class="calibre1">during setup. Now the tuning knob will now select between only these three stations so that </p>
<p class="calibre1">the first 90 degrees of rotation selects station 1 and the next 90 degrees selects station 2, etc. This makes tuning a doddle, no more squinting at a tuning dial or fiddling with band selection.

<p class="calibre1">rotation of the tuning dial during normal operation. After programming, the radio should be </p>

<p class="calibre1">To program via a PC, a serial cable can be connected to GND and COM (TXD pin). For op-</p>

<p class="calibre1">can then only be controlled by the PC until the next restart. Using the terminal, you can </p>
<p class="calibre1">tune the receiver and assign frequencies between 65 MHz and 108 MHz to the individual </p>
<p class="calibre1">memory locations. If, for example, ten stations were previously stored and now only four </p>
<p class="calibre1">stations are required, a special end marker must be written to location 5. </p>

<p class="calibre1">After finishing the programming process, the radio needs to be restarted for the settings </p>
<p class="calibre1">to take effect. Alternatively, the receiver can just be used as a PC radio by default. It is also possible to create custom applications with special firmware, such as a kitchen radio </p>
<p class="calibre1">for parents with children. A station chosen by one of the children will automatically switch back to the station preferred by a parent after 30 minutes. Or a sleep radio, which turns off automatically after a predetermined time. Those who wish can modify the firmware to do </p>
<p class="calibre1">exactly as they please. The possibilities are endless. </p>

<p class="calibre1">people don’t have the time or inclination to bring back to life. If you are planning a retro vibe for your home decoration and think a particular vintage set would be the cherry on the </p>
<p class="calibre1">cake why not bring the radio back to life by installing a home radio? It doesn’t have to be </p>
<p class="calibre1">final, but you could simply use the original speaker and just retire the vacuum tube chassis. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The result would most likely be a particularly beautiful sound, almost like in the old days, but without the crackles and distortion that dogged radio reception in the early days. One </p>
<p class="calibre1">thing is clear; for sound quality, none of these old radios would be able to compete with </p>
<p class="calibre1">modern FM broadcasts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It may also be possible to actually use the output tube EL84 and volume control of the </p>
<p class="calibre1">original set, but first you would need to remove all the RF tubes from their sockets. Then, </p>
<p class="calibre1">all that’s missing is where to position the tuning potentiometer for the home radio. One </p>
<p class="calibre1">solution might be a mechanical coupling with the tuning capacitor. It may be less hassle </p>
<p class="calibre1">if one of the tone controls were repurposed. Whatever, you would certainly end up with </p>
<p class="calibre1">something quite unique! </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">10.10 The Elektor DSP Radio</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">A world receiver which works on all the FM, LW, MW, and SW bands, but doesn’t have any of </p>

<p class="calibre1">When it comes to a universal receiver, the first thing I look for is a clean FM reception, </p>
<p class="calibre1">preferably in stereo and with RDS station display, so I can see what I am listening to. This receiver offers these features with excellent FM sensitivity and sound quality. It uses the </p>
<p class="calibre1">SI4735 chip so RDS is also included. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The second requirement is that the radio’s shortwave performance should have the abil-</p>
<p class="calibre1">ity to pick up distant AM stations. Here, too, the receiver excels with excellent shortwave </p>
<p class="calibre1">reception characteristics, with very high sensitivity combined with good large signal toler-</p>
<p class="calibre1">ance, allowing the use of long antennas. An effective Automatic Level Control (ALC) brings </p>
<p class="calibre1">the received signal into the optimal range, so that low gain antennas can be used without </p>
<p class="calibre1">much loss in performance. This receiver’s selectivity is also outstanding, and you can freely choose the bandwidth in several stages, which is usually only available with top-end receivers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This receiver also covers the medium and long wave bands. An antenna input allows for the </p>
<p class="calibre1">connection of an external antenna for any frequency bands. If a simple whip antenna or </p>
<p class="calibre1">some other indoor aerial is fitted it will usually pick up too much domestic interference so you can alternatively connect to a ferrite antenna here. </p>

<p class="calibre1">At first glance, the receiver’s circuit doesn’t show much evidence of typical RF technolo-</p>
<p class="calibre1">gy or VHF receiver design. That’s because all essential functions are integrated into the </p>
<p class="calibre1">Si4735. Only the antenna input circuitry reveals the RF nature of this design. The antenna </p>
<p class="calibre1">signal from the BNC socket K4 or screw terminal K3 first passes through a diode limiter with D4 and D5. L2 is the FM coil with a value of 0.1 µH. The jumper JP1 is normally in position </p>
<p class="calibre1">3-2, connecting the bottom end of the FM coil to the AM input. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What you can’t see in the circuit diagram is that in FM mode, the receiver sets its internal AM 'variable capacitor’ to 500 pF, which effectively shorts the FM coil to ground. In AM </p>
<p class="calibre1">mode, however, the antenna signal now passes through L2 as an extension coil to the AM </p>
<p class="calibre1">resonant circuit made up of L3, L4, L5 and the automatically tuned 'variable capacitor’ </p>
<p class="calibre1">inside the Si4735 at pin 4 (AMI). The diode switch with D6 and D7 determines which fixed </p>
<p class="calibre1">inductances are effective. If necessary, a portion of the coils are be shorted to ground via the 1N4148 diodes. In normal operation, the three jumpers JP2 to JP4 are closed, but alternative input circuits or a ferrite antenna can be connected via the jumper pins. For example, a medium wave ferrite antenna can be connected to JP3, and a shortwave loop to JP2. If a </p>
<p class="calibre1">whip antenna is only used for FM, JP1 is set to short pins 1-2. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The stereo output signal of the Si4735 is led to a stereo jack socket as an audio output via C28 and C29, for connection to an external amplifier or powered speakers. The output is </p>
<p class="calibre1">short-circuit-proof with an output impedance of 10 k at 80 mVeff approx. Two LM386 ICs </p>
<p class="calibre1">are used as audio power amplifiers, allowing speakers to be connected at K5. The maxi-</p>
<p class="calibre1">mum power into 8 Ω is about 300 mW. A stereo volume potentiometer is not required in </p>
<p class="calibre1">the circuit. The microcontroller IC3 (ATmega168) controls the volume of both channels and </p>
<p class="calibre1">all other functions of the Si4735 via software using the I2C bus with its two control signals SDA and SCL. It reads the voltage at the linear potentiometer P1 via the analog input ADC0 </p>
<p class="calibre1">and converts it into corresponding commands for the Si4735. Tuning control is implement-</p>
<p class="calibre1">ed via a rotary encoder (ENC1) which connects to two input pins. The four pushbuttons S2 </p>
<p class="calibre1">to S5 are additional controls. To show received signal strength a PWM output for connecting </p>
<p class="calibre1">an optional S-meter, generates a 500 Hz square wave signal with variable duty cycle and </p>
<p class="calibre1">a median voltage between 0 and 3.3 V. Almost any measuring device up to about 1 mA </p>
<p class="calibre1">can be connected to it with a suitable resistor. The ATmega168 microcontroller is clocked </p>
<p class="calibre1">at 8 MHz, which is independent of the receiver’s actual frequency. The receiver derives its </p>
<p class="calibre1">reception frequency from a connected clock crystal which runs at 32.768 kHz. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There are three options for powering the radio: through the USB port, a 6 V mains adapter </p>
<p class="calibre1">or a battery pack with four cells (4.8 to 6 V). This voltage VIN is applied to the two LM386 </p>
<p class="calibre1">amplifiers, the LCD backlight, and the input of the voltage regulator IC1 (LP2950-3.3), </p>
<p class="calibre1">which regulates it down to 3.3 V for the radio chip, microcontroller, and LCD. The power </p>
<p class="calibre1">switch S1 on the board only switches the voltage from K1 (battery or power supply), while </p>
<p class="calibre1">the voltage from the USB port remains on. If you want to save power, you can turn off the </p>
<p class="calibre1">LCD backlight by removing the link at JP5. The LCD is still readable without the backlight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The receiver consumes around 50 mA and works down to a voltage of 4.0V so you can </p>
<p class="calibre1">expect good battery life. </p>

<p class="calibre1">A new type of radio chip designed for use in small scanning headphone radios was intro-</p>
<p class="calibre1">duced only a few years ago. The BK1068 from the Chinese company Beken bears a strong </p>
<p class="calibre1">resemblance to the BK1079 from the same company; it comes in a slightly larger housing </p>
<p class="calibre1">with the unusual 1 mm pin spacing. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Radio Builder's Book</p>
<p class="calibre1">This IC seems to strongly resemble the DSP radios chips from Silicon Labs like the SI4735, </p>
<p class="calibre1">indicating that the BK1079/1068 is actually a DSP radio. This explains its high quality, as </p>
<p class="calibre1">the output signal is absolutely clean and shows no traces of the stereo subcarrier signal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another advantage over the TDA7088 is that the volume can be adjusted internally. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Seek input and the Volume input have about half the operating voltage in their idle </p>
<p class="calibre1">state. The chip detects when the inputs are pulled to GND or VDD potential. Additionally, </p>
<p class="calibre1">there is a Reset function that sets the lowest frequency and a Power-Down input (PDN) </p>
<p class="calibre1">which turns the chip on and off. This allows the radio to operate without a switch to the </p>
<p class="calibre1">battery. When the radio is turned off, it consumes hardly any power and retains the last </p>
<p class="calibre1">used settings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">An adapter board for this IC is available from Modul-Bus. This brings the small SMD IC to </p>
<p class="calibre1">a handy DIP8 format. The ten connections are reduced to eight pins because GND appears </p>
<p class="calibre1">twice (pin 5 and pin 7) and the unused RCLK input is connected to Vdd. This board makes </p>
<p class="calibre1">experimenting easy. All you need is a 3 V battery and a few control pushbuttons to build a </p>
<p class="calibre1">high-quality radio. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The circuit shows a typical application with pushbuttons for all the functions. The Scan and Vol button inputs are actually tristate with a middle level at half the operating voltage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Therefore, switching the pin to either GND or Vdd assigns two functions to one input. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Figure 10.41: External component connections</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">This module requires minimal external components if some of the switch functions are </p>
<p class="calibre1">ignored. The IC starts with maximum volume. A single scan button is sufficient because it </p>
<p class="calibre1">automatically switches back to the beginning at the upper end of the band, allowing the </p>
<p class="calibre1">IC to scan in a loop. The on/off button switches the IC to the power-down mode and back </p>
<p class="calibre1">to the active mode, while keeping all current settings, such as frequency and volume. This </p>
<p class="calibre1">means that unlike older scanning radios, you don’t need to scan for your preferred station </p>
<p class="calibre1">every time. Another advantage is that you can begin scanning in either direction. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Index</p>
<p class="calibre1">In Figure 10.42, there is a setup using six pushbuttons on a test board. A 470 Ω resistor is placed between the two up/down pushbuttons to prevent a short circuit if both pushbuttons </p>
<p class="calibre1">are accidentally pressed simultaneously. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Figure 10.42: Test setup testing all of the switch possibilities. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The IC is actually intended to drive headphones with 16 Ω impedance but delivers more </p>
<p class="calibre1">than ample volume and excellent sound quality. Tests have also shown that an 8 Ω speaker </p>
<p class="calibre1">can also be used. An output voltage of up to about 1 Vpp was measured. This volume level </p>
<p class="calibre1">is sufficient for most domestic environments without an additional power amplifier. The </p>
<p class="calibre1">module is also ideal for sprucing up an old tube radio, either using its own power amplifier or feeding into the existing tube power amp. </p>

<p class="calibre1">For a long time, radio construction was the first step into electronics. </p>

<p class="calibre1">neglected. Elementary radio technology and easy-to-do experiments are </p>
<p class="calibre1">and a general fondness for the </p>
<p class="calibre1">basics of electronics. </p>
<p class="calibre1">particularly well suited as a learning field for electronics because you can </p>
<p class="calibre1">start with the simplest basics here. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But the connection to modern digital technology is also obvious, for </p>
<p class="calibre1">example, when it comes to modern tuning methods such as PLL and </p>
<p class="calibre1">DDS or modern DSP radios. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This book aims to give an overview and present a collection of simple RF </p>
<p class="calibre1">projects. I would like to support you to develop your own ideas, to design </p>
<p class="calibre1">your own receivers and to test them. </p>
