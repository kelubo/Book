<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">The equations describing how a bipolar junction transistor circuit works are usually simplified to ratios of resistances or currents. Many assumptions are made so that the calculations are straightforward — and most of the time this works just fine. The designer and technician should understand that underlying the simplifications and assumptions is a fundamental relationship that can have a major effect on how a circuit behaves as temperature changes. This month, you’ll observe the effect directly.</span></p>
<p class="subhead2"><span class="calibre7">PN Junction Volt-Amp  Characteristic</span></p>
<p class="body-text24"><span class="charoverride5">You’ve probably seen the basic graphs of Figure 1, perhaps combined in a single graph with different current scales for forward and reverse current. These graphs show the relationship between current and voltage — the</span><span class="charoverride13"> I-V characteristic </span><span class="charoverride5">— for any semiconductor PN junction. The equation that generates the graphs is called the </span><span class="charoverride13">Fundamental Diode Equation</span><span class="charoverride5">. With positive for both voltage and current defined as from the P-type to the N-type material: </span></p>

<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">where </span><span class="charoverride13">I</span><span class="charoverride20">D</span><span class="charoverride13"> </span><span class="charoverride5">is the </span><span class="charoverride13">forward current</span><span class="charoverride5"> through the diode, </span><span class="charoverride13">V</span><span class="charoverride20">D</span><span class="charoverride13"> </span><span class="charoverride5">is the </span><span class="charoverride13">forward voltage</span><span class="charoverride5"> across the diode, and </span><span class="charoverride13">I</span><span class="charoverride20">S</span><span class="charoverride13"> </span><span class="charoverride5">is the </span><span class="charoverride13">reverse-bias saturation current</span><span class="charoverride5"> that flows when </span><span class="charoverride13">V</span><span class="charoverride20">D</span><span class="charoverride13"> </span><span class="charoverride5">is negative. </span><span class="charoverride5">(</span><span class="charoverride13">I</span><span class="charoverride20">s</span><span class="charoverride13"> </span><span class="charoverride5">is measured at the lowest voltage that will produce a stable current level — typically a few tens of mV of reverse bias</span><span class="charoverride5"> and is much smaller than the typical values for </span><span class="charoverride13">reverse leakage current</span><span class="charoverride5"> specified in datasheets.) </span><span class="charoverride5">η</span><span class="charoverride5"> is the</span><span class="charoverride13"> ideality factor </span><span class="charoverride5">(also called the </span><span class="charoverride13">quality factor </span><span class="charoverride5">or </span><span class="charoverride13">emission coefficient</span><span class="charoverride5">) that depends on how the carriers of current recombine at the diode junction and varies from 1 to 2. For normal currents, </span><span class="charoverride5">η</span><span class="charoverride5"> = 2 works well for most diodes.</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">The most interesting bit of this equation is the </span><span class="charoverride13">thermal voltage,</span><span class="charoverride5"> </span><span class="charoverride13">V</span><span class="charoverride20">T</span><span class="charoverride5"> = </span><span class="charoverride13">kT/q</span><span class="charoverride5"> where </span><span class="charoverride13">k </span><span class="charoverride5">is the Boltzmann constant that relates the energy of a particle (the electron) and its temperature, </span><span class="charoverride13">T</span><span class="charoverride5"> is the absolute temperature in degrees Kelvin, and </span><span class="charoverride13">q</span><span class="charoverride5"> is the charge of an electron. At room temperature (300 K is commonly used in simulation software), </span><span class="charoverride13">V</span><span class="charoverride20">T</span><span class="charoverride5"> = 28.85 mV. A common simplification is that </span><span class="charoverride13">V</span><span class="charoverride20">T</span><span class="charoverride13"> </span><span class="charoverride5">≈</span><span class="charoverride13"> T </span><span class="charoverride5">/</span><span class="charoverride13"> </span><span class="charoverride5">11,600. </span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">What happens as temperature increases? Since </span><span class="charoverride13">V</span><span class="charoverride20">T</span><span class="charoverride13"> </span><span class="charoverride5">goes up along with </span><span class="charoverride13">T</span><span class="charoverride5">, if everything else on the right side of the equation stays constant, </span><span class="charoverride13">I</span><span class="charoverride20">D</span><span class="charoverride13"> “</span><span class="charoverride5">should” go down. How about an experiment? Figure 2 shows a simple test circuit for evaluating a diode’s I-V characteristic. V and A represent a voltmeter and ammeter, respectively. Assuming you are using multimeters, set them to read 0 – 1 V and an initial current of 0 – 200 or 0 – 300 </span><span class="charoverride5" xml:lang="ar-SA">µ</span><span class="charoverride5">A. </span></p>
<p class="figure"><img src="../images/00090.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">The op-amp is connected as an adjustable voltage source with its output set by the 10 kΩ pot. Any garden variety op-amp will suffice, such as the venerable LM741. Your power supply needs to have an output of at least </span><span class="charoverride5" xml:lang="ar-SA">±</span><span class="charoverride5">3 V and up to ± 15 V will do if it is within the op-amp’s maximum voltage ratings.</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">Select an ordinary silicon diode such as a 1N914, 1N4148, or 1N4000-series part. Before connecting the diode, set the op-amp output voltage to 0.3 V on the voltmeter. Then connect the diode and slowly increase the voltage to 0.7 or 0.75 V in  0.05 V steps, recording both voltage and current. (A spreadsheet to generate a graph is provided on the Hands-On Radio web page.</span><span class="charoverride14"><a id="ft8" href="part0008_split_003.html#fn8">1</a></span><span class="charoverride5">) The measurements start at 0.3 V because current is too low to be measured with ordinary test equipment below that level. Most multimeters are not very accurate at the low end of their ranges so expect your measured values to diverge quite a bit from the calculated values.</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">Now cool the diode by at least 30 </span><span class="charoverride5">°</span><span class="charoverride5">C and measure the currents again. One way to get a relatively consistent temperature during the measurements is to put a metal object that is many times larger than the diode, such as a large nut, in your home freezer for an hour or so. Orient the diode so you can sit the object directly on it. Measure current through the diode and when the reading stabilizes begin taking data — you’ll have to work fast so the temperature remains about the same.</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">Why does </span><span class="charoverride13">I</span><span class="charoverride20">D</span><span class="charoverride5"> have different values when the diode is cooled? Because the value of </span><span class="charoverride13">I</span><span class="charoverride20">S</span><span class="charoverride5"> is strongly dependent on temperature, as is </span><span class="charoverride13">V</span><span class="charoverride20">T</span><span class="charoverride5">. In fact, for silicon diodes, the value of </span><span class="charoverride13">I</span><span class="charoverride20">S</span><span class="charoverride5"> changes by about 7 % / </span><span class="charoverride5">°</span><span class="charoverride5">C, a positive shift with temperature. That means </span><span class="charoverride13">I</span><span class="charoverride20">S</span><span class="charoverride5"> will double (or halve) with every 10 </span><span class="charoverride5">°</span><span class="charoverride5">C increase (or decrease) in temperature! </span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">The two temperature dependencies for </span><span class="charoverride13">V</span><span class="charoverride20">T</span><span class="charoverride5"> and </span><span class="charoverride13">I</span><span class="charoverride20">S</span><span class="charoverride5"> work against each other. As temperature increases, </span><span class="charoverride13">V</span><span class="charoverride20">T</span><span class="charoverride5"> goes up which works to lower </span><span class="charoverride13">I</span><span class="charoverride20">D</span><span class="charoverride5"> because it is in the exponent’s denominator. On the other hand, increasing </span><span class="charoverride13">I</span><span class="charoverride20">S</span><span class="charoverride5"> causes </span><span class="charoverride13">I</span><span class="charoverride20">D</span><span class="charoverride5"> to increase. Thus, it is a balancing act with the change in </span><span class="charoverride13">I</span><span class="charoverride20">S</span><span class="charoverride13"> </span><span class="charoverride5">having the larger effect. While the exact change requires some detailed calculations, around room temperature the net result is that </span><span class="charoverride13">V</span><span class="charoverride20">D</span><span class="charoverride5"> changes about –2.2 mV / </span><span class="charoverride5">°</span><span class="charoverride5">C if current through the diode is held constant.</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">Next, go the other way: heat the diode by about the same amount (putting the metal object in hot water will do the job) and take the same set of measurements. Figure 3 shows a set of data I took for a 1N4148 diode. As you can see, below about 100 µA, my measurements started to show some signs of being inaccurate. (This is typical of low-level home-lab test setups, so don’t be too concerned if the data doesn’t make a nice straight line.) The diode you choose and the temperatures you obtain will probably give significantly different values of current — all you are trying to do is observe the effect of temperature.</span></p>
<p class="figure"><img src="../images/00091.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">If you’d like some extra credit, try taking the measurements by controlling </span><span class="charoverride13">I</span><span class="charoverride20">D</span><span class="charoverride5"> and measuring </span><span class="charoverride13">V</span><span class="charoverride20">D</span><span class="charoverride5">. Figure 2B shows how to turn the op-amp into a current source. (See </span><span class="charoverride5">Experiment #3 — Op-Amps for an explanation of this circuit.)</span><span class="charoverride14">1</span><span class="charoverride5"> Start with a short circuit instead of the diode and confirm that with the pot set to maximum resistance, approximately +V / 10 kΩ of current is flowing. Reinstall the diode and adjust the current to get about the same values of </span><span class="charoverride13">V</span><span class="charoverride20">D</span><span class="charoverride5"> as in the previous set of measurements. You should see fairly similar results.</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">Double your extra credit by trying a germanium diode, such as the common 1N34A. Germanium (Ge) diodes have a much higher value of </span><span class="charoverride13">I</span><span class="charoverride20">S</span><span class="charoverride5"> than do silicon (Si) diodes by three to four orders of magnitude! Thus, the current values you measure will be much larger for a given value of </span><span class="charoverride13">V</span><span class="charoverride20">D</span><span class="charoverride5">. That can work to our advantage, however, because for a given amount of</span><span class="charoverride13"> I</span><span class="charoverride20">D</span><span class="charoverride5">, a germanium diode will have a lower </span><span class="charoverride13">V</span><span class="charoverride20">D</span><span class="charoverride5"> than a silicon diode. That may be an advantage in a sensitive circuit, such as a diode detector.</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">While you are at it, remember that a bipolar junction transistor is constructed from a pair of back-to-back PN junctions. Substitute the collector-base or emitter-base junction of an inexpensive PNP (2N3906 or 2N4404) or NPN (2N3904 or 2N4401) transistor for the diode. The resulting measurements should be fairly similar. Remember that temperature dependency when designing your next transistor amplifier!</span></p>
<p class="subhead2"><span class="calibre7">Temperature Sensing</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">Since the effect of temperature on diode current and voltage are so predictable, it’s quite possible to make a temperature sensor out of a diode. Rearranging the diode equation gives</span></p>
<p class="body-text19"><img src="../images/00092.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre19"/></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">So you can see that measuring </span><span class="charoverride13">V</span><span class="charoverride20">D</span><span class="charoverride5"> while holding </span><span class="charoverride13">I</span><span class="charoverride20">D</span><span class="charoverride13"> </span><span class="charoverride5">constant gives a pretty good idea of temperature. Using a microprocessor to “do the math” or applying a comparator circuit to detect when </span><span class="charoverride13">V</span><span class="charoverride20">D</span><span class="charoverride5"> crosses a threshold is an excellent method of temperature control at low cost.</span></p>
