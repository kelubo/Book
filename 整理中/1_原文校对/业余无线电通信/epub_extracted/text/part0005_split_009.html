<p class="experiment-number1" id="t10"><span class="charoverride12">Experiment #174 — Switching Amplifiers</span></p>
<p class="body-text9"><span class="charoverride5">As part of our General and Amateur Extra class license studies, we have to learn a few things about amplifier classes. </span><span class="charoverride13">Class</span><span class="charoverride5"> refers to how the amplifying devices (tube or transistor) operate, and how the output impedance matching and filter circuits work.</span></p>
<p class="subhead1"><span class="charoverride12">Class Background</span></p>
<p class="body-text9"><span class="charoverride5">The early Hands-On Radio experiments (#1 and #2, for example) stress the importance of </span><span class="charoverride13">quiescent-</span><span class="charoverride5"> or </span><span class="charoverride13">Q-point</span><span class="charoverride5">.</span><span class="charoverride14"><a id="ft26" href="part0005_split_009.html#fn26">1</a></span><span class="charoverride15"> </span><span class="charoverride5">The Q-point is the combination of voltage and current in a circuit when no input signal is present. </span></p>
<p class="body-text9"><span class="charoverride5">The output will follow a </span><span class="charoverride13">load line</span><span class="charoverride5"> (see Experiment #77) that describes voltages and currents possible for the load at the amplifier’s output. The device’s output current can be increased until it reaches </span><span class="charoverride13">saturation</span><span class="charoverride5">, the point at which further changes in input have no effect. Similarly, the output current can be reduced to zero at </span><span class="charoverride13">cutoff</span><span class="charoverride5">. </span></p>
<p class="body-text9"><span class="charoverride5">The location of the Q-point on the load line determines how “close” the amplifier is to saturation or cutoff. The amplifier circuit’s configuration, Q-point location, load, gain, and output circuit characteristics all combine to determine the amplifier’s output waveform, linearity, and efficiency. There are several common combinations and resulting behaviors of the amplifier — these are called </span><span class="charoverride13">amplifier classes</span><span class="charoverride5">.</span></p>
<p class="subhead1"><span class="charoverride12">Classes A, B, and AB</span></p>
<p class="body-text9"><span class="charoverride5">The easiest way to compare these classes is in terms of </span><span class="charoverride13">conduction angle</span><span class="charoverride5"> — the number of degrees in one cycle during which the device is conducting current in its </span><span class="charoverride13">linear region</span><span class="charoverride5">, from 0</span><span class="charoverride5" xml:lang="ar-SA">°</span><span class="charoverride5"> to 360</span><span class="charoverride5" xml:lang="ar-SA">°</span><span class="charoverride5">.</span></p>
<p class="body-text9"><span class="charoverride5">In </span><span class="charoverride13">Class A</span><span class="charoverride5"> operation, the device (Figure 1A) conducts during the entire cycle; a conduction angle of 360</span><span class="charoverride5" xml:lang="ar-SA">º</span><span class="charoverride5">. If the load line is linear and the input doesn’t “overdrive” the circuit out of its </span><span class="charoverride13">linear region</span><span class="charoverride5"> (between saturation and cutoff), the output waveform is an exact reproduction of the input. This is a true “linear amplifier.” Class A amplifiers have poor efficiency (about 50% maximum) because of their continuous current.</span></p>
<p class="figure"><img src="../images/00035.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="body-text9"><span class="charoverride5">In </span><span class="charoverride13">Class B</span><span class="charoverride5"> operation, the conduction angle is 180</span><span class="charoverride5" xml:lang="ar-SA">º</span><span class="charoverride5"> (half of the cycle). Class B amplifiers are more efficient (a maximum of 78.5%) than Class A, because they are only in their linear region half the time. But they are quite non-linear. Class B amplifiers typically use a pair of devices that conduct on alternate half cycles (</span><span class="charoverride13">push-pull</span><span class="charoverride5"> operation). Their outputs are combined to produce a complete output signal.</span></p>
<p class="body-text9"><span class="charoverride13">Class AB</span><span class="charoverride5"> operation (Figure 1A) “splits the difference” between Class A and B with a conduction angle between 180° and 360</span><span class="charoverride5" xml:lang="ar-SA">°</span><span class="charoverride5">. This is a compromise — Class AB amplifiers are more linear than Class B, and more efficient than Class A. Class AB is very popular for SSB operation, whether tube or transistor. Some readers are probably thinking, “But Class AB is still really non-linear. How can that work and still put out a clean signal?” Hold that thought.</span></p>
<p class="subhead1"><span class="charoverride12">Class C and Harmonics</span></p>
<p class="body-text9"><span class="charoverride5">The final “traditional” class is </span><span class="charoverride13">Class C</span><span class="charoverride5"> (Figure 1B), in which the device is in its linear region for a short period, with a conduction angle of only 25 – 50% (90 – 180</span><span class="charoverride5" xml:lang="ar-SA">º</span><span class="charoverride5">). The output current consists of sine-like pulses. Class C amplifiers are very non-linear and are used to amplify signals for which only the frequency is preserved — FM and CW, for example. Because the device is only in the linear region for short periods, the efficiency of Class C amplifiers can be as high as 85%.</span></p>
<p class="body-text9"><span class="charoverride5">Clearly, Class AB, B, and C amplifiers generate a lot of harmonic distortion, because they cut off some or most of the waveform. (Remember that we are talking about an RF waveform, not audio.) There would be significant in-band distortion products as well, particularly for Class C. </span></p>
<p class="body-text9"><span class="charoverride5">Let’s do an experiment. Build the common-emitter amplifier of Experiment #1 with a 50 kΩ pot instead of R1 and R2. Adjust the bias to change the Q-point, and with a 1 kHz input signal, observe the output signal spectrum by using a sound card audio analyzer (see Experiments #64 and #65). Compare the spectra for Class A, B, AB, and C operation.</span></p>
<p class="body-text9"><span class="charoverride5">To get rid of the harmonic energy requires the output circuit to act as a filter as well as provide an impedance match. When you adjust the </span><span class="scbf">TUNE</span><span class="charoverride5"> function of a tube amplifier, you are bringing the output circuit to resonance where it acts as a band-pass filter. (If you have a linear amplifier, tune it up at reduced power into a dummy load, then listen for your second or third harmonic on a second receiver. Change the tuning of the amplifier while watching the S-meter to get an idea of signal level. You should be able to see (and hear) the effects of mistuning.</span></p>
<p class="subhead1"><span class="charoverride12">Class D and Switching Amplifiers</span></p>
<p class="body-text9"><span class="charoverride13">Class D</span><span class="charoverride5"> goes farther than Class C — the amplifier acts as a </span><span class="charoverride13">pulse width modulated </span><span class="charoverride5">(PWM) switch by setting the bias and drive so that the device is either fully on (saturated) or fully off (cutoff). As Experiment #9 shows, these two states have low-power dissipation compared to the linear region. Class D is a type of </span><span class="charoverride13">switching amplifier</span><span class="charoverride5">.</span></p>
<p class="body-text9"><span class="charoverride5">The switch operates at </span><span class="charoverride13">f</span><span class="charoverride20">PWM</span><span class="charoverride5">, which is many times the frequency of the signal to be amplified. The duration of each pulse is controlled by the amplitude of the input waveform to change the pulse’s average energy. The switch is turned on and off so rapidly that it spends very little time in the linear region, and its conduction angle is very small. This creates a series of current pulses.</span></p>
<p class="body-text9"><span class="charoverride5">A low-pass filter then removes the high-frequency switching components and leaves only the desired average-energy signal. Essentially, a Class D amplifier is a switching mode power supply, with the input signal acting as the output voltage control signal. </span></p>
<p class="body-text9"><span class="charoverride5">Because the switching frequency must be many times the frequency of the signals to be amplified, Class D circuits are only used for audio. The switching frequency is typically greater than  100 kHz and easily separated from the desired audio range below 20 – 30 kHz. There are many Class D audio amplifier integrated circuits (ICs), and because they are so efficient (more than 90%), they are the circuit of choice in battery-powered gear like smartphones and music players. (The Sparkfun BOB-11044 Class D amplifier kit based on the TPA2005D1 chip — </span><span class="charoverride12"><a href="http://www.sparkfun.com" class="calibre7">www.sparkfun.com</a></span><span class="charoverride5"> — only costs a few dollars and makes a great experiment.)</span></p>
<p class="subhead1"><span class="charoverride12">Class E and F</span></p>
<p class="body-text9"><span class="charoverride5">At RF, the frequency of the switching pulses, </span><span class="charoverride13">f</span><span class="charoverride15">0</span><span class="charoverride5">, is so high that it takes more work to keep the device out of the linear region. Remember that current should be high or voltage should be high, but not both at the same time. This is accomplished by the tuned output networks, as shown in Figure 2, described more completely by Iulian Rosu, YO3DAC/VA3IUL.</span><span class="charoverride14"><a id="ft27" href="part0005_split_009.html#fn27">2</a></span></p>
<p class="body-text9"><span class="charoverride5">For </span><span class="charoverride13">Class E</span><span class="charoverride5">, the output network’s series-LC network is tuned to the desired RF frequency of operation. The capacitance across the switch is charged and discharged at the same rate. The tune<a id="_idTextAnchor006" class="calibre7"></a>d circuit causes voltage at the device to go to zero just as the current is beginning to increase. This keeps switching losses low, and the tuned circuit takes care of the harmonics. A separate tuned network is required for each band of operation.</span></p>
<p class="figure"><img src="../images/00036.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="body-text9"><span class="charoverride5">The related </span><span class="charoverride13">Class F</span><span class="charoverride5"> amplifier uses a parallel-LC trap in the output circuit to block </span><span class="charoverride13">f</span><span class="charoverride15">3</span><span class="charoverride5">, the third and strongest harmonic of a square wave, while passing the fundamental (</span><span class="charoverride13">f</span><span class="charoverride15">0</span><span class="charoverride5">). Again, with careful tuning, the voltage and current are never maximum at the same time, the switch stays out of its linear region, and efficiency is high.</span></p>
<p class="subhead1"><span class="charoverride12">Out-Classed</span></p>
<p class="body-text9"><span class="charoverride5">There are other classes, as well. </span><span class="charoverride13">Class G</span><span class="charoverride5"> is similar to a Class AB amplifier, but switches between two voltage levels to reduce power dissipation at low signal levels. </span><span class="charoverride13">Class I</span><span class="charoverride5"> uses two devices driven with complementary pulse duty cycles to cancel harmonics and follow the input waveform. </span><span class="charoverride13">Class S</span><span class="charoverride5"> is a variation on Class D, and </span><span class="charoverride13">Class T</span><span class="charoverride5"> uses digital signal processing (DSP) to optimize pulse widths in a Class D amplifier for better performance.</span><span class="charoverride14"><a id="ft28" href="part0005_split_009.html#fn28">3</a></span></p>
