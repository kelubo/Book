<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">My recent column on designing matching networks generated a fair amount of interest from readers interested in solving a particular matching problem or learning more about impedance matching.</span><span class="charoverride14"><a id="ft14" href="part0007_split_003.html#fn14">1</a></span><span class="charoverride5"> I thought it would be a good idea to have a practice session and explore a little bit of the Smith chart at the same time.</span></p>
<p class="subhead2"><span class="calibre7">A Moving Tale</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">Let’s start by having a look at Figure 1, which shows the various possibilities of using </span><span class="scbf4">L</span><span class="charoverride5"> networks to match a load (Z</span><span class="charoverride15">LOAD</span><span class="charoverride5">) to some nominal reference impedance (Z</span><span class="charoverride15">0</span><span class="charoverride5">).</span><span class="charoverride14"><a id="ft15" href="part0007_split_003.html#fn15">2</a>, <a id="ft16" href="part0007_split_003.html#fn16">3</a></span><span class="charoverride5"> These are simplified Smith charts, with the unshaded half representing the set of impedance values that are matched using the circuit immediately below. Each of the four network configurations shown can be designed to </span><span class="charoverride13">transform</span><span class="charoverride5"> (match) any impedance in the unshaded region to the impedance at the center of the chart. </span></p>
<p class="figure"><img src="../images/00068.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">Each particular starting point — the load, Z</span><span class="charoverride15">LOAD</span><span class="charoverride5"> — can be transformed into Z</span><span class="charoverride15">0</span><span class="charoverride5"> in two steps. The first step takes you to a point labeled Z</span><span class="charoverride15">1</span><span class="charoverride5"> on the border of the matchable region. The second step takes you from Z</span><span class="charoverride15">1</span><span class="charoverride5"> to the chart’s reference impedance, Z</span><span class="charoverride15">0</span><span class="charoverride5">, which is usually 50 Ω for Amateur Radio systems. Each move is following some kind of curved path. What are those curves?</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">Figure 2 has two parts. The first part is a standard Smith chart, showing impedance coordinates on the black outer circle and center line, plus a set of red arcs and circles. The second part shows the coordinates of </span><span class="charoverride13">admittances</span><span class="charoverride5">, which are the reciprocals of impedances. Admittance coordinates share the outer circle and center line with impedance coordinates but use a mirror-imaged set of blue arcs and circles. </span></p>
<p class="figure"><img src="../images/00069.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">Any point on the chart’s center line represents a pure resistance or conductance (R + </span><span class="charoverride13">j</span><span class="charoverride5">0 or G + </span><span class="charoverride13">j</span><span class="charoverride5">0) and any point on the outer circle represents a pure reactance or susceptance (0 + </span><span class="charoverride13">j</span><span class="charoverride5">X or 0 + </span><span class="charoverride13">j</span><span class="charoverride5">B). Points on one of the red circles all have the same resistance and points on one of the blue circles all have the same conductance. Points on a red arc all have the same reactance and points on a blue arc all have the same susceptance.</span><span class="charoverride14"><a id="ft17" href="part0007_split_003.html#fn17">4</a></span><span class="charoverride5"> Think of this set of intersecting circles, arcs, and lines as our impedance-matching chessboard.</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">How does this chessboard “work?” Pieces (impedances or admittances) are moved (transformed) by adding reactances connected in series or parallel (called a </span><span class="charoverride13">shunt</span><span class="charoverride5"> connection). As shown in the circuits of Figure 1, the moves can only be along the constant resistance (or conductance) circles, since they don’t add or subtract resistance (or conductance). For example, if I add some positive inductive reactance in series with a load, the added reactance will “move” the load clockwise along a constant-resistance circle. Similarly, if I add some positive capacitive susceptance in parallel with a load, the point will move clockwise along a constant-conductance circle. Adding reactance or susceptance in series or parallel with load can only “move the load” around the chart on these circles.</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">If I want to transform Z</span><span class="charoverride15">LOAD</span><span class="charoverride5"> to the reference impedance Z</span><span class="charoverride15">0</span><span class="charoverride5">, then I have to move part of the way along one type of circle until it encounters the complementary circle that intersects the chart’s center. Then I move along that new circle to Z</span><span class="charoverride15">0</span><span class="charoverride5">. Just like a knight in chess or a Manhattan cab. I have to move first in one direction, then switch to another direction. </span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">Figure 3 shows how there are two solutions to every such problem. Start with the point labeled Z</span><span class="charoverride15">LOAD</span><span class="charoverride5">. It has an impedance of approximately 0.5 – </span><span class="charoverride13">j</span><span class="charoverride5"> 0.1 Ω. (Remember, everything is normalized so that the center point, presumably 50 + </span><span class="charoverride13">j</span><span class="charoverride5"> 0 Ω</span><span class="charoverride5">, is represented as 1.0 + </span><span class="charoverride13">j</span><span class="charoverride5"> 0 Ω.) By adding series X</span><span class="charoverride15">L</span><span class="charoverride5"> or X</span><span class="charoverride15">C</span><span class="charoverride5">, I can move clockwise (X</span><span class="charoverride15">L</span><span class="charoverride5">) or counterclockwise (X</span><span class="charoverride15">C</span><span class="charoverride5">) along the red R = 0.5 Ω circle. I need to add enough reactance to reach the blue circle for G = 1.0 S (S stands for siemens, the unit of conductance). Once there, I can move to Z</span><span class="charoverride15">0</span><span class="charoverride5"> by adding either shunt L or shunt C as noted. One set of “moves” represents what happens in the circuit of Figure 1C and the other in Figure 1D. Depending on the value of Z</span><span class="charoverride15">LOAD</span><span class="charoverride5">, there are always two possible circuits that will get you to Z</span><span class="charoverride15">0</span><span class="charoverride5">.</span></p>
<p class="figure"><img src="../images/00070.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">Why would I choose one circuit over the other since both choices wind up at the same point on the chart? Unlike the chess knight that must always move in an </span><span class="scbf4">L</span><span class="charoverride5"> of 2 squares by 1 square, the</span><span class="scbf4"> L</span><span class="charoverride5"> network’s pair of reactances can take a wide range of values. One of those pairs will have more practical or convenient values (or be cheaper to purchase) than the other. </span></p>
<p class="subhead2"><span class="calibre7">Working On Your Knight Moves</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">Okay, your turn! You should now understand why Wetherell’s L network calculator can solve an impedance matching problem for only two out of the four possible L-C  L networks.</span><span class="charoverride14"><a id="ft18" href="part0007_split_003.html#fn18">5</a></span><span class="charoverride5"> Those are the two network configurations with Z</span><span class="charoverride15">LOAD</span><span class="charoverride5"> in matchable regions of the Smith chart.</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">Another thing you’ve just learned: If an L network can’t match an impedance — turn it around! If you look at the matchable regions of the two networks that are mirror images of each other, such as in Figure 1A and 1C, you’ll see they are complementary. So by turning the network around, the previously unmatchable impedance is guaranteed to be in the matchable region for the new circuit’s configuration.</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">Let’s try some example calculations to get you into the game and moving your pieces around. Find the two circuits in Figure 1 that can be used for each example and the component values required. (Answers are at the end of the Notes list.)</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">Example 1: Z</span><span class="charoverride15">LOAD </span><span class="charoverride5">is the feed point impedance of a 10.1 MHz full-wave loop: 110 + </span><span class="charoverride13">j</span><span class="charoverride5"> 50 Ω</span><span class="charoverride5">. </span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">Example 2: Z</span><span class="charoverride15">LOAD</span><span class="charoverride5"> is the feed point impedance of a Yagi’s driven element at 144.2 MHz: 22 – </span><span class="charoverride13">j</span><span class="charoverride5"> 10 Ω.</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">Example 3: Z</span><span class="charoverride15">LOAD</span><span class="charoverride5"> is the feed point impedance of an off-center-fed dipole at  24.9 MHz: 250 – </span><span class="charoverride13">j</span><span class="charoverride5"> 150 Ω.</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">Once you get the hang of it, you can have a lot of fun trying different versions of the matching networks, pushing the impedances to extreme values (high, low, highly reactive), and evaluating which circuit you’d choose to build.</span></p>
