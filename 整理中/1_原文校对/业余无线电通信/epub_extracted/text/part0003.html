<p class="body-text3"><span class="charoverride7">Welcome to the third volume of Hands-On Radio Experiments. The companion Volumes 1 and 2 span a 15-year set of columns in </span><span class="charoverride8">QST</span><span class="charoverride7">. When the column started long ago, we weren’t sure if it would run more than a few months, but readers were certainly interested and here we are, some 179 columns later!</span></p>
<p class="body-text3"><span class="charoverride7">This volume is similar to the previous volumes in that it presents an eclectic mix of topics spanning the practical through theory. There are several columns that describe how components — even wires and PC traces — behave at RF, which is often quite different from their performance at lower frequencies and dc. Knowing how to account for the difference can make or break a project or repair.</span></p>
<p class="body-text3"><span class="charoverride7">Volume 3 has a bit more emphasis on transmission lines, antennas, and some associated circuit functions. Even if the column doesn’t include an experiment per se, be sure to build one or two of the antennas or circuits to see how they work. Then be sure to compare the results to what you expected. That’s a very important part of learning about radio and wireless in general.</span></p>
<p class="body-text3"><span class="charoverride7">The columns on grounding and bonding generated so much interest that I extended the conversation to the recent ARRL book of the same name. This is an area of many mis- and incomplete understandings, which lead to confusion and poor practices. It is the Hands-On Radio readership that deserves a great deal of credit for encouraging me to collect the necessary information and put it into one book where it can serve as a reference and a guide to station and antenna system building.</span></p>
<p class="body-text3"><span class="charoverride7">Finally, the last columns covered that most mysterious of topics, Maxwell’s equations. With their somewhat advanced notation, they look very intimidating. I’ve tried to demystify both the symbols and the concepts, explaining how radio waves appear as a consequence of “inconveniencing electrons” by accelerating and decelerating them. Since we make use of radio waves in ham radio, it seemed like a good idea for us to understand where they come from!</span></p>
<p class="body-text3"><span class="charoverride7">This volume completes the Hands-On Radio series in its present form. There will be other columns from excellent writers, just as there were in the past. ARRL members will enjoy searching the ARRL archives for columns by legendary writers like George Grammar, W1DF, and Doug DeMaw, W1FB, who were certainly inspirations to me. Or why not write an article yourself? </span><span class="charoverride8">QST</span><span class="charoverride7"> is our shared resource and depends on each of us for contributions, as well as readership. If you know a topic well, your first article might be close at hand.</span></p>
<p class="body-text4"><span class="charoverride7">	Thanks for reading and 73!</span></p>
