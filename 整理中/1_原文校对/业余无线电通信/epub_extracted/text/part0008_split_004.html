<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">One of the first bits of technical lore every ham, indeed, every electronic hobbyist learns is the venerable Ohm’s Law. This simple formula explains the relationship between current through a material with a known resistance, and the voltage across the material. Students dutifully memorize it in all its forms: </span><span class="charoverride13">I = E / R, E = I </span><span class="charoverride5">×</span><span class="charoverride13"> R, </span><span class="charoverride5">and</span><span class="charoverride13"> R = E / I</span><span class="charoverride5"> but often ask the question, “Where do E and I come from?” They understand the use of </span><span class="charoverride13">R</span><span class="charoverride5"> to represent resistance. The use of </span><span class="charoverride13">E</span><span class="charoverride5"> for voltage and </span><span class="charoverride13">I</span><span class="charoverride5"> for current is a little confusing. Why not </span><span class="charoverride13">V</span><span class="charoverride5"> and </span><span class="charoverride13">C</span><span class="charoverride5"> or </span><span class="charoverride13">V</span><span class="charoverride5"> and </span><span class="charoverride13">A</span><span class="charoverride5">? That’s a very good question and its answer goes back to the beginning of the electric era.</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">Instructors correctly respond that “</span><span class="charoverride13">E</span><span class="charoverride5"> stands for </span><span class="charoverride13">electromotive force</span><span class="charoverride5"> or </span><span class="charoverride13">emf</span><span class="charoverride5">.” Isn’t that just a fancy way of saying “voltage?” Not really. Let’s go back to the early 1800s, when experimenters like Faraday and Henry and </span><span class="charoverride5" xml:lang="ar-SA">Ø</span><span class="charoverride5">rsted were discovering electric and magnetic fields, the relationships between them, and their ability to influence the movement of a mysterious substance known as electric charge. (Some of these early discoveries are related in Hands-On Radio Experiments #117 and #118.</span><span class="charoverride14"><a id="ft10" href="part0008_split_004.html#fn10">1</a></span><span class="charoverride5">) </span></p>
<p class="subhead2"><span class="calibre7">Before the Electron</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">The early experimenters were completely in the dark about what was moving around in their wires and reacting to the presence or motion of electric or magnetic fields. Even Faraday’s concept of a field that explained how energy could be distributed in space was radical and new. So all they knew was electric charge and that there was a force that could make the charge move — the electromotive force.</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">Remember that no one at the time had the slightest idea what electric charge was. Dalton’s description of the atomic role in chemistry had only been introduced between 1802 and 1805, and Lord Kelvin’s discovery and description of the electron as an individual particle didn’t come until 1897. Bohr’s model of the hydrogen atom with electrons arranged in shells around a nucleus and which could leave an atom and move about, was not developed until 1913. Even today, we don’t really understand what electric charge actually is, why it exists, or even what the electron consists of. That those early experimenters were able to ascertain fundamental laws which still hold true today is nothing short of remarkable!</span></p>
<p class="subhead2"><span class="calibre7">From E to V</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">Yes, yes, but what about </span><span class="charoverride13">E</span><span class="charoverride5"> and </span><span class="charoverride13">V</span><span class="charoverride5">? If you browse through an introductory electrical engineering textbook that introduces students to the world of electric fields and circuits, you will likely see that the book begins with these same basic relationships between fields and current. Students learn a general description of what makes electrons move in response to electric fields and magnetic fields and the initial equations usually use </span><span class="charoverride13">E</span><span class="charoverride5"> or </span><span class="charoverride13">e</span><span class="charoverride5"> to represent the electromotive force. (The symbol </span><span class="charoverride5">ε</span><span class="charoverride5"> is also used.)</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">In this general environment, it is appropriate for the equations to use electromotive force. The resulting electron motion is analyzed through a volume or across a surface that has some </span><span class="charoverride13">conductivity</span><span class="charoverride5"> (</span><span class="charoverride5">σ</span><span class="charoverride5">) which describes the ease with which electrons move through it. Figure 1 shows a diagram of charge moving through a cross-section area, A. </span><span class="charoverride13">Resistivity</span><span class="charoverride5"> (</span><span class="charoverride5">ρ</span><span class="charoverride5">) is the reciprocal of conductivity, so that </span><span class="charoverride5">ρ</span><span class="charoverride13"> = 1 / </span><span class="charoverride5">σ</span><span class="charoverride13">. </span><span class="charoverride5">Resistivity is measured as ohm-meters or ohm-m.</span></p>
<p class="figure"><img src="../images/00093.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">So far, we haven’t seen a hint of a circuit and all the equations are using </span><span class="charoverride13">E</span><span class="charoverride5"> and the general parameter </span><span class="charoverride13">current density</span><span class="charoverride5"> (</span><span class="charoverride13">J</span><span class="charoverride5">) which is the amount of current per unit of area. Boring! When do we get to the good stuff? Patience is eventually rewarded as the conducting material is formed into a thin loop — a circuit — and subjected to electric and magnetic fields. Now the electrons are moving around in this circuit and </span><span class="charoverride13">J</span><span class="charoverride5"> can be replaced by </span><span class="charoverride13">current</span><span class="charoverride5">, </span><span class="charoverride13">I</span><span class="charoverride5">, the flow of all electric charge through the entire cross-sectional area of this thin conducting volume.</span><span class="charoverride14"><a id="ft11" href="part0008_split_004.html#fn11">2</a></span><span class="charoverride5"> Similarly, it now makes sense to talk </span><span class="charoverride5">about the loop’s </span><span class="charoverride13">resistance</span><span class="charoverride5">, represented by </span><span class="charoverride13">R</span><span class="charoverride5">, since the current is now flowing in this highly constrained path. R accounts for all of the material’s resistance and for a cylindrical wire as in Figure 2, </span><span class="charoverride13">R = </span><span class="charoverride5">ρ</span><span class="charoverride13"> l / A</span><span class="charoverride5">, where </span><span class="charoverride13">l</span><span class="charoverride5"> is the wire’s length, </span><span class="charoverride13">A</span><span class="charoverride5"> is its cross-sectional area, and </span><span class="charoverride5">ρ</span><span class="charoverride5"> is the material’s resistivity. (We are only referring to dc, so the </span><span class="charoverride13">skin effect</span><span class="charoverride5"> of ac current does not apply.)</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">We still have no batteries or power supplies, just an externally generated field that is a source of emf, represented by </span><span class="charoverride13">E</span><span class="charoverride5"> and so the relationship between the three parameters becomes the familiar </span><span class="charoverride13">I = E / R</span><span class="charoverride5">. Here </span><span class="charoverride13">E</span><span class="charoverride5"> represents the emf developed all the way around the loop by the external field. If you did the experiments of Experiment #118, you observed this current as the magnet moved near the coil of wire which made a long loop. </span></p>
<p class="figure"><img src="../images/00094.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">Figure 3 shows how to see this emf by constructing your own loop and placing it near a power transformer or motor which is the source of a changing magnetic field. (For a field to generate emf in a loop that makes a current flow, the field must be changing or the circuit must be moving through the field.)</span></p>
<p class="figure"><img src="../images/00095.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">To measure the emf the loop is cut as in Figure 3, creating a pair of terminals. Current flow stops, of course, but an </span><span class="charoverride13">electric potential</span><span class="charoverride5"> now exists between those terminals.</span><span class="charoverride14"><a id="ft12" href="part0008_split_004.html#fn12">3</a></span><span class="charoverride5"> By measuring it, we can tell how much energy (in joules) an amount of electric charge (in coulombs) will gain from the effects of the field on the loop. Electric potential is thus measured in joules/coulomb and the value of 1 joule/coulomb defined as 1 volt in honor of Alexander Volta, inventor of the battery. Electric potential was given the simpler name of </span><span class="charoverride13">voltage</span><span class="charoverride5"> as well. The symbol for volts is the familiar V and voltage is represented in an equation by </span><span class="charoverride13">V</span><span class="charoverride5"> or </span><span class="charoverride13">v</span><span class="charoverride5">.</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">Can </span><span class="charoverride13">V</span><span class="charoverride5"> be substituted for </span><span class="charoverride13">E</span><span class="charoverride5"> without risk of confusion? If the discussion is of ordinary electronic circuits, the answer is almost always yes. It is safe to say that substituting </span><span class="charoverride13">I = V / R</span><span class="charoverride5"> for </span><span class="charoverride13">I = E / R</span><span class="charoverride5"> will not get you into trouble around ham radio equipment! You should use </span><span class="charoverride13">E</span><span class="charoverride5">, however, when the discussion is about fields — for motors, generators, antennas, transformers, etc. Another place you’ll see emf is the term </span><span class="charoverride13">kickback emf</span><span class="charoverride5"> that refers to the reverse voltages generated by inductances when current through them is suddenly interrupted or turned off, causing the magnetic field created by current through the inductance. Similarly, a motor develops a </span><span class="charoverride13">back emf</span><span class="charoverride5"> that opposes the applied voltage, limited current through the motor to only that required to drive the load and account for internal losses.</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">Don’t confuse units of measurement, such as volts (V), amperes (A), and ohms (</span><span class="charoverride5">Ω</span><span class="charoverride5">), with their corresponding physical phenomena, such as electric potential (also </span><span class="charoverride13">V</span><span class="charoverride5">), current, (</span><span class="charoverride13">I</span><span class="charoverride5">), or resistance (</span><span class="charoverride13">R</span><span class="charoverride5">). For example, Ohm’s Law is </span><span class="charoverride13">never</span><span class="charoverride5"> written as A = V / </span><span class="charoverride5">Ω</span><span class="charoverride5">.</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">We have answered almost all of the original question but what about the mysterious </span><span class="charoverride13">I</span><span class="charoverride5">? Returning back to the early days, experimenters had learned to discriminate between a quantity of charge and the  flow of charge (current). The French experimenter Ampere (for whom the unit of current was later named) gave flow of charge the name “Intensité de Courant” (Intensity of Current) and assigned it the symbol </span><span class="charoverride13">I</span><span class="charoverride5"> or </span><span class="charoverride13">i</span><span class="charoverride5"> in equations. (This is one reason why electrical engineers use </span><span class="charoverride13">j</span><span class="charoverride5"> instead of the mathematician’s </span><span class="charoverride13">i </span><span class="charoverride5">to represent the imaginary square root of negative one in their equat<a id="_idTextAnchor000" class="calibre7"></a>ions.)</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">The ampere is a flow of one coulomb (C) per second. How many electrons make up 1 C? 6.24×10</span><span class="charoverride14">18</span><span class="charoverride5"> electrons! </span><span class="charoverride13">Basic Radio</span><span class="charoverride5"> from 1942 gives us an idea of how many that is: “If 3 million people were to count for 8 hours per day at the rate of 200 per minute, they would have to count from the time of the Trojan Wars in 500 BC down to the present” in order to count the number of electrons passing by at a rate of 1 ampere.</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">Another source of frequent confusion is the overuse of the symbol </span><span class="charoverride13">C</span><span class="charoverride5">, which is used at various points to represent coulombs, capacitance (measured in farads with the symbol F), battery capacity and battery charge or discharge rates, not to mention the speed of light, </span><span class="charoverride13">c</span><span class="charoverride5"> — see?</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">In closing, I would like to acknowledge the comments of Dana Brown, AD5VC, and Sam Neal, N5AF, on the “ham_instructor” e-mail reflector.</span><span class="charoverride14"><a id="ft13" href="part0008_split_004.html#fn13">4</a></span><span class="charoverride5"> Sharing expertise is one of the hallmarks of Amateur Radio and it is particularly important for instructors so that our newest licensees have a common (and correct) understanding of radio’s physical environment.</span></p>
