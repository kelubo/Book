<p class="experiment-number1" id="t6"><span class="charoverride12">Experiment #169 — Gas Discharge Tubes</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">In experiment #121, I covered transient protection for the various insults that occur in vehicles and other power systems.</span><span class="charoverride14"><a id="ft22" href="part0009_split_006.html#fn22">1</a></span><span class="charoverride5"> Protection from a lightning strike, either direct or indirect, requires special, sterner measures across your station, though. First, let’s back up and understand what we’re protecting against.</span></p>
<p class="subhead2"><span class="charoverride12">Lightning Energy</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">A typical lightning strike is composed of three to four impulses per strike. Peak current for the first pulse averages around 18 kA (98% of the strikes fall between 3 kA to 140 kA at their peak). For the second and subsequent impulses, the current will be about half the initial peak. The typical interval between impulses is approximately 50 ms. Figure 1 shows a typical impulse, referred to as the </span><span class="charoverride13">IEEE 8/20 model waveform</span><span class="charoverride5">. Remember, this is an </span><span class="charoverride13">average</span><span class="charoverride5">, and half of lightning strikes have more energy than this waveform!</span></p>
<p class="figure"><img src="../images/00141.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">Voltages created by this current pulse can be enormous and depend on the resistance (R) and inductance (L) through which the current flows. According to Faraday’s Law, the faster that current changes (</span><span class="charoverride5" xml:lang="ar-SA">Δ</span><span class="charoverride5">i / </span><span class="charoverride5" xml:lang="ar-SA">Δ</span><span class="charoverride5">t, where the Greek letter delta, </span><span class="charoverride5" xml:lang="ar-SA">Δ</span><span class="charoverride5">, means “the change in”) through an inductance, the higher the voltage that is created. Higher current through a resistance also means higher voltage, per Ohm’s Law:</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">V = I </span><span class="charoverride5">×</span><span class="charoverride5"> R + L </span><span class="charoverride5">×</span><span class="charoverride5"> </span><span class="charoverride5" xml:lang="ar-SA">Δ</span><span class="charoverride5" xml:lang="ar-SA">i</span><span class="charoverride5">/</span><span class="charoverride5" xml:lang="ar-SA">Δ</span><span class="charoverride5" xml:lang="ar-SA">t</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">While the majority of lightning’s energy is pulsed dc, there is a substantial amount of RF created by the fast rise time of the pulses. A typical strike rise-time of 1.8 </span><span class="charoverride5" xml:lang="ar-SA">μ</span><span class="charoverride5">s translates into a radiated RF signal peaking at 139 kHz. Rise times can vary from a very fast 0.25 </span><span class="charoverride5" xml:lang="ar-SA">μ</span><span class="charoverride5">S to a very slow 12 </span><span class="charoverride5" xml:lang="ar-SA">μ</span><span class="charoverride5">S, yielding an RF range from 1 MHz down to 20 kHz. When lightning “attaches” to the </span><span class="charoverride13">air terminal</span><span class="charoverride5"> (where the leader channel reaches the grounded object), the rise time for current can be as short as 10 nS. The result is that lightning’s energy extends upward in frequency to 10 MHz and higher.</span></p>
<p class="subhead2"><span class="charoverride12">Clamping a Lightning Transient</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">What causes the damage when lightning strikes — voltage or current? The answer is both! That’s a lot of energy, and a lot of spectrum. The combination of high energy and wide spectrum makes protecting equipment a difficult challenge.</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">Any protection device that depends on internal resistance to dissipate the energy as heat will still produce high voltages even from indirect strikes. Putting inductance in series with the transient might help at low frequencies, but is incompatible with RF receiving and transmitting equipment.</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">While disconnecting equipment is nearly foolproof, it’s not always possible or practical. We need something that will divert the transient energy away from equipment inputs or outputs. Whatever we employ, it has to be “invisible” until it is triggered. Then it must activate quickly enough not to pass damaging energy, and to remain activated until the transient event is over, then return to invisibility until the next event. It must require no power to operate and be insensitive to RF. </span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">The only component with the characteristics we need and that can withstand repeated transients is the </span><span class="charoverride13">gas discharge tube</span><span class="charoverride5"> or </span><span class="charoverride13">GDT</span><span class="charoverride5">. </span></p>
<p class="subhead2"><span class="charoverride12">GDT Basics</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">Several examples of GDTs used by amateurs are seen in Figure 2. The photograph of a GDT shows the shape and placement of the metal electrodes. They are typically made of tungsten or some other tough metal that can withstand repeated short arcs. The schematic symbol includes a small dot next to the electrodes. This indicates the presence of gas. A proprietary combination of gases is used, along with electrode spacing, to control the </span><span class="charoverride13">breakdown</span><span class="charoverride5"> voltage. Once an arc is created, the resistance between the electrodes is quite small until the arc current falls and is </span><span class="charoverride13">quenched</span><span class="charoverride5">. The GDT is then inert until the next transient.</span></p>
<p class="figure"><img src="../images/00142.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">The GDT is a type of </span><span class="charoverride13">crowbar</span><span class="charoverride5"> protection. As stated in the Littelfuse GDT catalog:</span></p>
<p class="long-quote1"><span class="charoverride5">A crowbar device limits the energy delivered to the protected circuit by abruptly changing from a high-impedance state to a low-impedance state in response to an elevated voltage level. Having been subjected to a sufficient voltage level, the crowbar begins to conduct. While conducting, the voltage across the crowbar remains quite low…and thus, the majority of the transient’s power is dissipated in the circuit’s resistive elements and not in the protected circuit nor the crowbar itself. This allows the crowbar to be able to withstand and protect loads from higher voltages and/or higher current levels for a greater duration of time than clamping devices.</span><span class="charoverride14"><a id="ft23" href="part0009_split_006.html#fn23">2</a></span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">A similar type of crowbar device is a </span><span class="charoverride13">spark gap</span><span class="charoverride5"> or </span><span class="charoverride13">air gap protector</span><span class="charoverride5">. Spark gaps can be easily made from common materials, and ARRL publications have many examples, including the use of automotive spark plugs for open-wire feed lines.</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">When most amateur equipment used vacuum tubes, a spark gap might have been enough protection. After all, the tubes themselves operated with voltages of several to many hundreds of volts and could withstand even short arc-overs. Transistors and integrated circuits (ICs) are much less forgiving. Once breakover voltage is reached and the arc is established, a typical GDT limits the voltage across the electrodes to 15 V or so, which is well within the safe voltage range for nearly all radio equipment.</span></p>
<p class="subhead2"><span class="charoverride12">Applying GDT Protection</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">As you can see in Figure 2, there are lots of different styles of GDT packages. The </span><span class="charoverride13">leaded</span><span class="charoverride5"> and </span><span class="charoverride13">cartridge</span><span class="charoverride5"> packages are the most common in amateur stations. GDTs are rated by breakdown voltage and energy handling ability. The Littelfuse CG-series is suitable for most amateur applications.</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">For protecting dc or low-frequency control and telephone lines, the leaded package is the most common. These components can be connected to screw terminals or barrier strips. For rotator control lines, measure the root mean square (RMS) voltage from the control box and multiply by 1.414 to get peak voltage to ground (2.8 for peak-to-peak). Add another 10 – 20% to provide a margin and determine the required breakdown voltage. Remember that telephone line ringing voltage can be as high as 150 V</span><span class="charoverride15">PK-PK</span><span class="charoverride5">.</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">At RF and especially in circuits that must withstand transmitter output voltages, a cartridge-style GDT is used. Shown in Figure 3 is a set of four lightning protectors with UHF connectors for attaching to feed lines. The GDT is connected between the shield and center conductor of the feed line, with the protector body also mounted on a grounded metal mounting bracket. Several </span><span class="charoverride13">QST</span><span class="charoverride5"> advertisers offer these protectors for either low-power for full legal-limit operation.</span></p>
<p class="figure"><img src="../images/00143.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">There are two caveats for using these protectors. You still need a good ground system for full lightning protection, including a lightning protection plan and bonding for all protected equipment. (See the 2002 series of </span><span class="charoverride13">QST</span><span class="charoverride5"> articles by Ron Block, KB2UYT, at </span><span class="charoverride12"><a href="http://www.arrl.org/radio-technology-topics" class="calibre7">www.arrl.org/radio-technology-topics</a></span><span class="charoverride5"> under “Safety.”)</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">You should also be aware that there are two basic versions of the commercial protectors: one that passes dc current and one that does not. If you plan on using a remote device, such as a preamp or antenna switch that requires feed line power, be sure not to purchase the dc blocking version. A call to the vendor will help you make the right choice.</span></p>
