<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">An antenna system begins at a radio’s output connector and ends in the space around the antenna, including the ground and everything conductive that is nearby (in terms of wavelengths). One never uses just an antenna — rather, an antenna system! What often seems a simple task — measuring, cutting, and hanging up a skyhook — really involves many more questions than you might expect. </span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">One of the questions you must answer is “What feed line do I use?” and, as with many technical endeavors, the answer begins, “It depends…” While the choice also involves cost and the mechanical aspects of installation, the focus of this column is on the electrical aspects. Assuming the feed line is adequately rated for the power levels you’ll be using, the choice boils down to loss in the line.</span></p>
<p class="subhead2"><span class="calibre7">Evaluating Loss with </span><span class="charoverride13">TLW</span><span class="charoverride5"> </span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">Recently, Dean Straw, N6BV, former editor of </span><span class="charoverride13">The</span><span class="charoverride5"> </span><span class="charoverride13">ARRL Antenna Book</span><span class="charoverride5">, updated his incredibly useful </span><span class="charoverride13">TLW</span><span class="charoverride5"> program (</span><span class="charoverride13">Transmission Line for Windows</span><span class="charoverride5">).</span><span class="charoverride14"><a id="ft6" href="part0007_split_001.html#fn6">1</a></span><span class="charoverride5"> The result is a more accurate assessment of systems using open-wire feed line, aka ladder line or window line. Often used as the feed line for multi-band “doublets” (wire antennas fed in the middle but not necessarily resonant on any band used), open-wire line (OWL) is often assumed to be less lossy than an equivalent length of coaxial cable. With the new version of </span><span class="charoverride13">TLW </span><span class="charoverride5">available, it seemed like a good idea to check this out. (This discussion doesn’t include the loss of effects of baluns anywhere in the system.)</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">Starting with the center-fed, half-wave dipole used on a single band (and maybe on the third harmonic, too), the use of coax is a good choice for moderate feed line length. The feed line SWR and associated losses will be reasonably low, it’s easy to connect at both ends, and it lends itself well to switching arrangements between several antennas.</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">Let’s have a look at an example of this type of antenna system: a center-fed, 66-foot long inverted </span><span class="scbf4">V</span><span class="charoverride5">, 50 feet above average ground, with 100 feet of feed line. According to </span><span class="charoverride13">EZNEC</span><span class="charoverride5"> (</span><span class="charoverride12"><a href="http://www.eznec.com" class="calibre7">www.eznec.com</a></span><span class="charoverride5">), at 7.1 MHz where the antenna is very nearly ½-wavelength long, the antenna’s feed point impedance is 65 – </span><span class="charoverride13">j</span><span class="charoverride5"> 41 Ω or 77 </span><span class="charoverride5">∠</span><span class="charoverride5">-32</span><span class="charoverride5">°</span><span class="charoverride5">.</span><span class="charoverride14"><a id="ft7" href="part0007_split_001.html#fn7">2</a></span><span class="charoverride5"> This load creates an SWR of 2.1:1 for 50 </span><span class="charoverride5">Ω</span><span class="charoverride5"> cable. One hundred feet of RG-213 coax has a total line loss of 0.7 dB and the SWR at the transmitter end of the line is 1.9:1. (The online </span><span class="charoverride13">VSWR-RL-Reflection Coefficient </span><span class="charoverride5">calculator by Giangrandi is another excellent free tool.</span><span class="charoverride14"><a id="ft8" href="part0007_split_001.html#fn8">3</a></span><span class="charoverride5">)</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">If instead we fed the inverted </span><span class="scbf4">V</span><span class="charoverride5"> with the same length of 450 Ω OWL, the new version of </span><span class="charoverride13">TLW</span><span class="charoverride5"> calculates SWR at the antenna to be 6.3:1 and the line loss as 0.43 dB. While it looks like OWL is slightly less lossy, that figure doesn’t include any losses in the impedance matching unit required at the line’s input where SWR is still 5.7:1. ARRL Lab measurements of</span><span class="charoverride13"> </span><span class="charoverride5">full-legal limit antenna tuners shows an average loss of about 11% for an SWR of 4:1 on 40 meters, which is 0.7 dB.</span><span class="charoverride14">3</span><span class="charoverride5"> The total system loss when using OWL in this antenna system is about 1.1 dB. The advantage swings slightly more to coax for shorter feed line lengths and to OWL as feed line length increases.</span></p>
<p class="subhead2"><span class="calibre7">Tuned Feeders</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">You can also use an old trick — </span><span class="charoverride13">tuned feeders</span><span class="charoverride5"> — to reduce the need for impedance matching. If the OWL is extended to the closest length at which it is an integer number of ½-wavelengths long, the input and output impedances of the line will be very nearly the same. One wavelength of OWL at 7.1 MHz is 126 feet. At this length, a 50 Ω transmitter output sees an impedance of 73 – </span><span class="charoverride13">j</span><span class="charoverride5"> 41 Ω (SWR of 2.1:1) and system loss is reduced to 0.5 dB, slightly better than for the coaxial cable. Adjusting the line length to 128.1 feet brings the system almost exactly to resonance with an input impedance of  73 </span><span class="charoverride5">Ω, an SWR of 1.5:1, and total system losses of 0.56 dB. Remember that this will </span><span class="charoverride13">only</span><span class="charoverride5"> work on the one band and at the design frequency — you may still wind up needing impedance matchng at the band edges but the SWR will be lower than with the 100-foot feed line.</span></p>
<p class="subhead2"><span class="calibre7">Feed Lines for Multi-band Doublets</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">The fun really begins when the antenna is to be used on several bands, including those for which the antenna is not an odd number of ½-wavelengths long, occasionally creating extreme feed point impedances. George Cutsogeorge, W2VJN, created an </span><span class="charoverride13">EZNEC</span><span class="charoverride5"> model for </span><span class="charoverride13">The</span><span class="charoverride5"> </span><span class="charoverride13">ARRL Antenna Book</span><span class="charoverride5"> that shows center-fed feed point impedances on the HF ham bands for a 100-foot long doublet, installed at 50 feet over average ground.</span><span class="charoverride14"><a id="ft9" href="part0007_split_001.html#fn9">4</a></span><span class="charoverride5"> I used the new version of </span><span class="charoverride13">TLW</span><span class="charoverride5"> to calculate losses and SWR at the antenna feed point for 100 feet of both RG-213 coax and 450 Ω OWL. All of the data is shown in Table 1.</span></p>
<p class="figure"><img src="../images/00061.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">In this common situation it’s not even close — feed line losses for OWL are uniformly lower than for coax, sometimes by a lot. That’s not the entire story because you’ll still have to provide some kind of impedance matching device at the transmitter most of the time. As we have seen, that adds additional losses, regardless of whether the feed line is OWL or coax. In general and except in extraordinary cases, the old advice is still good: OWL is best for feeding multi-band, non-resonant antennas from the perspective of system losses.</span></p>
<p class="subhead2"><span class="calibre7">Feed Lines for Matched Antennas</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">Most of our ham-band antennas, whether Yagis, dipoles, or ground-plane verticals, are designed with a feed point impedance that matches 50 </span><span class="charoverride5">Ω coaxial cables. For these antennas, OWL would not be a good choice due to mechanical and impedance matching considerations. So, how does one choose the right coax for these antennas?</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">You could start with the manufacturer’s specified loss per standard length (usually 100 feet) and pick the lowest-loss line you can afford. However, antenna system designers generally approach the problem from the standpoint of </span><span class="charoverride13">allowable loss</span><span class="charoverride5">. In other words, what is the maximum acceptable amount of feed line loss? They select feed line that for the required length will have less loss than the maximum amount. This is a somewhat harder problem to solve because of the calculations involved.</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">You’re in luck, however, because Frank Donovan, W3LPL, has performed those calculations already. The results are in Table 2 (related tables are also available in </span><span class="charoverride13">The ARRL Antenna Book, 22nd Edition</span><span class="charoverride5">), which shows the length of cable that results in 1 dB of </span><span class="charoverride13">matched loss </span><span class="charoverride5">— the loss for a feed line terminated in its characteristic impedance.</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">To use these figures, begin by dividing the length of feed line you’ll need to use by the maximum acceptable loss in dB. This determines the lower limit for the number of feet per dB of loss in the cable. Find the column showing the frequency at which you are working. Locate the entry in that column with the lowest value of feet/dB </span><span class="charoverride13">greater</span><span class="charoverride5"> than the calculated lower limit. That cable is the lossiest you can use and still satisfy your total loss requirement. For example, if you can tolerate 5 dB of feed line loss in a 300-foot run at 440 MHz, your lower loss limit is 300 / 5 = 60 feet / dB. In the 440 MHz column, LDF4-50A hardline is the lossiest cable you can use — start shopping! Note that the values of feet/dB don’t increase uniformly from bottom to top due to variations in cable performance over the wide frequency range shown in the table.</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">What if the cable is </span><span class="charoverride13">not</span><span class="charoverride5"> matched? Additional loss will result as the power is reflected back and forth in the feed line. Figure 1 shows just how much more loss. This chart, developed by Joe Reisert, W1JR, combines matched loss and additional SWR-caused loss into a single set of curves.</span><span class="charoverride14"><a id="ft10" href="part0007_split_001.html#fn10">5</a></span><span class="charoverride5"> To find the total loss of your feed line, start with the load SWR (at the antenna) on the horizontal axis. Travel vertically to the curve (or an interpolation between curves) corresponding to the matched loss of the feed line you’ve selected. Travel horizontally to the vertical axis to find the total attenuation of the feed line. If this total is still below your maximum allowed loss, you can use that cable. If not, find the point at which the maximum allowed loss and load SWR intersect. That will show the maximum matched loss you can accept. You can then work backwards using Table 2 to find the cable you need.</span></p>

<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">Feed line selection is not always so complicated. Most of the time you can just hook up the antenna and you’ll work stations. To be sure you’re getting the most out of your precious watts, though, these sorts of tools can help you make your decision.</span></p>
