<p class="experiment-number" id="t1"><span class="calibre7">Experiment #127 — Phasors, Part 2</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">No, not the kind of phaser you set on stun, silly! If you passed your General exam, you learned about phase and a little bit about angular frequency. Amateur Extra class licensees (and those studying for the Extra) have even used phasor notation, although it was called by another name. </span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">In this two-part column, we’ll start by develop</span><span class="charoverride5">ing basic concepts to show what a phasor is and how it relates to things you already understand. Then we’ll progress to examples of using phasors to describe electrical and radio phenomena, such as modulation. As ham radio begins to use more advanced types of modulation, understanding phasors will provide an important bridge between the familiar AM/SSB modulation and the future.</span></p>
<p class="subhead2"><span class="calibre7">The Sinusoid</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">Like many meals in radio, this dish begins with a sine wave and is seasoned with complex numbers. (You can find these subjects in the math tutorials for the General and Extra exams listed on the ARRL website.</span><span class="charoverride14"><a id="ft1" href="part0008_split_000.html#fn1">1</a></span><span class="charoverride5">) The sine wave (or </span><span class="charoverride13">sinusoid</span><span class="charoverride5">) looks like a regularly increasing and decreasing wave but as Figure 1 shows, it is really related to rotation.</span></p>
<p class="figure"><img src="../images/00077.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">Imagine a point revolving counter-clockwise in a circle around the origin of the complex plane as at the left of Figure 1. If the point is one unit from the origin the coordinates for each location visited by the point are [cos</span><span class="charoverride5">θ</span><span class="charoverride5">, </span><span class="charoverride13">i </span><span class="charoverride5">sin</span><span class="charoverride5">θ</span><span class="charoverride5">], where </span><span class="charoverride5">θ</span><span class="charoverride5"> (the Greek letter theta) is the angle from the positive x axis to the line from origin to the point. This circle, not surprisingly, is called the </span><span class="charoverride13">unit circle</span><span class="charoverride5"> because the value of its radius is 1 or unity.</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">As the point revolves around the origin,  </span><span class="charoverride5">θ</span><span class="charoverride5"> steadily increases from 0 to 360° and begins again at 0° with each cycle. (Counterclock-wise is considered the positive direction.) If the point always moves at the same speed, the frequency of the cycles around the origin, f, does not change and the point moves 360 × f degrees every second. That means the number of degrees a point has moved in t seconds, </span><span class="charoverride5">θ</span><span class="charoverride5"> = 360 </span><span class="charoverride5">× f × t. </span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">There are 2</span><span class="charoverride5">π</span><span class="charoverride5"> radians (another unit of angular measurement) in a circle so </span><span class="charoverride5">θ</span><span class="charoverride5"> = 2</span><span class="charoverride5">π</span><span class="charoverride5"> × f × t. The quantity 2</span><span class="charoverride5">π</span><span class="charoverride5">f is referred to as angular frequency, </span><span class="charoverride5">ω,</span><span class="charoverride5"> and you see it used in the formulas for reactance and many other electrical calculations that depend on frequency. </span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">Tying it all back together, the coordinates for the position of the point for every point in time as it moves around the circle are [cos(2</span><span class="charoverride5">π</span><span class="charoverride5">ft), </span><span class="charoverride13">i</span><span class="charoverride5"> sin(2</span><span class="charoverride5">π</span><span class="charoverride5">ft)] and the graph at the right of Figure 1 plots the point’s y (or imaginary) coordinate versus time, creating a sine wave. If we plotted the point’s x (or real) coordinate versus time, it would create a cosine wave.</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">Making the leap from a point moving around the circle to something more electrical, the magnitude of the point’s imaginary coordinate, sin(2</span><span class="charoverride5">π</span><span class="charoverride5">ft) = sin(</span><span class="charoverride5">w</span><span class="charoverride5">t), can also be a voltage or current or field strength. In fact, the familiar sine wave of ac power comes from the rotational motion of a generator’s field coil. As the coil passes through the magnetic field in the generator, the angle between the coil and the field changes in the same way as our point moves around the origin. This changing relationship between the coil and the field creates a sinusoidal voltage in the coil.</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">While both sine and cosine waves are generally referred to as sinusoids, they differ from each other in an important way. Starting from t = 0, the cosine wave starts at a value of 1 + 0</span><span class="charoverride13">i</span><span class="charoverride5"> and the sine wave at 0 + </span><span class="charoverride13">i</span><span class="charoverride5">. Other than starting at different values, the waves are identical. The cosine wave describes the real coordinate and the sine wave describes the imaginary coordinate. </span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">You can also think of that difference in starting value as a difference in angle, in which the sine wave is </span><span class="charoverride5">π</span><span class="charoverride5">/2 radians (90°) ahead of the cosine wave. This difference never changes because both waves are describing the same thing — constant rotation. The position of a particular point on the wave is its phase and the amount of the difference is called the </span><span class="charoverride13">phase angle</span><span class="charoverride5">, 90° in this case.</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">This is where the following trigonometric identities come from: sin</span><span class="charoverride5">θ</span><span class="charoverride5"> = cos(</span><span class="charoverride5">θ</span><span class="charoverride5"> – 90°) = cos(</span><span class="charoverride5">θ</span><span class="charoverride5"> – </span><span class="charoverride5">π</span><span class="charoverride5">/2) and cos</span><span class="charoverride5">θ</span><span class="charoverride5"> = sin(</span><span class="charoverride5">θ</span><span class="charoverride5"> + 90°) = sin  (</span><span class="charoverride5">θ</span><span class="charoverride5"> + </span><span class="charoverride5">π</span><span class="charoverride5">/2). Many, many more such relationships between sine and cosine waves become obvious (or at least more understandable) when viewed from the standpoint of rotation and the unit circle.</span></p>
<p class="subhead2"><span class="calibre7">Polar Notation</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">So far we have used the </span><span class="charoverride13">rectangular</span><span class="charoverride5"> form for the coordinates of our moving point: x + </span><span class="charoverride13">i</span><span class="charoverride5"> y. In most engineering technical literature, the letter </span><span class="charoverride13">j</span><span class="charoverride5"> is used instead of </span><span class="charoverride13">i</span><span class="charoverride5"> to avoid confusion with current and from here on in the column, we’ll do so, as well.</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">Next is the form that you may have already learned (or will learn!) for your Extra class exam and that is the polar form in which the coordinates take the form of a radius and an angle: r </span><span class="charoverride5">∠θ</span><span class="charoverride5">. Polar form is read “r at (an angle of) theta.” Using polar form coordinates for a point on the unit circle is easy because they’re always 1</span><span class="charoverride5">∠θ</span><span class="charoverride5">. If you are describing the point’s position as it whirls around the circle, you can use the equation for angular frequency we figured out earlier and the coordinates become 1</span><span class="charoverride5">∠</span><span class="charoverride5">(2</span><span class="charoverride5">π</span><span class="charoverride5">ft) = 1</span><span class="charoverride5">∠</span><span class="charoverride5">(</span><span class="charoverride5">ω</span><span class="charoverride5">t). So this particular method is a good shorthand way of describing what the moving point is doing.</span></p>
<p class="subhead2"><span class="calibre7">Introducing the Phasor</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">When dealing with RF signals and circuitry, it’s often true that the frequency of the signals doesn’t change. Think of an RC low-pass filter, for example: the input signal V</span><span class="charoverride15">IN</span><span class="charoverride5"> sin (</span><span class="charoverride5">ω</span><span class="charoverride5">t + 0) and output signal V</span><span class="charoverride15">OUT</span><span class="charoverride5"> sin (</span><span class="charoverride5">ω</span><span class="charoverride5">t + </span><span class="charoverride5">ϕ</span><span class="charoverride5">) have the same frequency, even though their amplitudes are different by the ratio of  V</span><span class="charoverride15">OUT</span><span class="charoverride5">/V</span><span class="charoverride15">IN</span><span class="charoverride5"> and they are offset in phase by </span><span class="charoverride5">ϕ</span><span class="charoverride5">. </span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">Assuming the same frequency for both signals, our polar form can now be simplified to V</span><span class="charoverride5">∠</span><span class="charoverride5"> </span><span class="charoverride5">ϕ</span><span class="charoverride5"> where </span><span class="charoverride5">ϕ</span><span class="charoverride5"> is just the phase angle between a signal and some reference signal or phase. The input signal to a circuit is usually the reference for measuring phase differences.</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">Hey, guess what? V</span><span class="charoverride5">∠</span><span class="charoverride5"> </span><span class="charoverride5">ϕ</span><span class="charoverride5"> is a phasor! A phasor is just a complex number that represents the amplitude and phase of a sinusoid and the V</span><span class="charoverride5">∠θ</span><span class="charoverride5"> polar notation is just convenient mathematical shorthand. Phasors are a type of vector – quantities that have both a magnitude and a direction. In the case of V</span><span class="charoverride5">∠</span><span class="charoverride5"> </span><span class="charoverride5">ϕ</span><span class="charoverride5">, the magnitude is |V| and the direction is the phase angle, </span><span class="charoverride5">ϕ</span><span class="charoverride5">, so the more cumbersome name “phase vector” was shortened to </span><span class="charoverride5">“phasor.” (As a vector, a phasor is often shortened even further and written as a single bold letter, such as </span><span class="charoverride12">V</span><span class="charoverride5"> or </span><span class="charoverride12">I</span><span class="charoverride5">.)</span></p>

<p class="sidebar-title"><span class="calibre7">Imagining a Wheel</span></p>
<p class="sidebar"><span class="charoverride24">If you are having trouble visualizing how the vigorous circular motion of a point translates into the smooth undulation of a sine wave, Figure 2 illustrates a demonstration that may help: Take the front wheel off of a bicycle and tape a battery-powered light to it so you can see the light from the side of the wheel. In a large room, have a friend hold the wheel, turn on the light, and give the wheel a gentle spin — say about one revolution per second. Turn off the room lights and have the friend walk slowly and steadily across the room with the wheel edge-on to you about 10 or  20 feet away. The up-and-down motion of the light stretched out across the room traces out a sinusoid! (Note to license exam instructors — this is also a good way to demonstrate the relationship between frequency and wavelength by changing the wheel’s spin rate as you walk across the room to represent a signal traveling at the speed of light.)</span></p>

<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">If our original sine wave is the reference signal, the phasor describing the sine wave is </span><span class="charoverride12">V</span><span class="charoverride5">∠</span><span class="charoverride5">0 and the cosine wave is </span><span class="charoverride12">V</span><span class="charoverride5">∠</span><span class="charoverride5">–90° or  </span><span class="charoverride12">V</span><span class="charoverride5">∠</span><span class="charoverride5">–</span><span class="charoverride5">π</span><span class="charoverride5">/2. Remember, the frequency is as</span><span class="charoverride5">sumed to be the same for both signals, whether 60 Hz from the power grid or 14.200 MHz on 20 meters. Figure 3 shows a </span><span class="charoverride13">phasor diagram</span><span class="charoverride5"> for the signals at the input and output of a filter.</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">There is a final way to describe the signal — the </span><span class="charoverride13">exponential form</span><span class="charoverride5"> in which it is represented as V </span><span class="charoverride5">e</span><span class="charoverride14">j</span><span class="charoverride14">θ</span><span class="charoverride5">. This form comes from the mathematics behind Euler’s equation</span><span class="charoverride14"><a id="ft2" href="part0008_split_000.html#fn2">2</a></span><span class="charoverride5"> in which the coordinates of our point are miraculously shown to be equivalent to </span><span class="charoverride5">e</span><span class="charoverride14">j</span><span class="charoverride14">θ</span><span class="charoverride5"> = cos </span><span class="charoverride5">θ</span><span class="charoverride5"> + </span><span class="charoverride13">j</span><span class="charoverride5"> sin </span><span class="charoverride5">θ</span><span class="charoverride5">. The serious and beautiful math</span><span class="charoverride14"><a id="ft3" href="part0008_split_000.html#fn3">3</a></span><span class="charoverride5"> behind this equation lies at the heart of much of electrical engineering and leads to the jaw-dropping Euler’s identity: </span><span class="charoverride5">e</span><span class="charoverride14">j</span><span class="charoverride14">π</span><span class="charoverride5"> = –1 which unites the two most widely used transcendental numbers (e and </span><span class="charoverride5">π</span><span class="charoverride5">), imaginary numbers </span><span class="charoverride5">(</span><span class="charoverride13">j</span><span class="charoverride5">), negation and unity.
