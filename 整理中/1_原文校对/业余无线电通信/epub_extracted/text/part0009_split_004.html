<p class="experiment-number1" id="t4"><span class="charoverride12">Experiment #160 — Transistors at High Frequencies</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">The first few columns of “Hands-On Radio” covered bipolar junction transistor (BJT) amplifier circuits like the Common Emitter (#1), Emitter Follower (#2), and Common Base (#28).</span><span class="charoverride14"><a id="ft15" href="part0009_split_004.html#fn15">1</a></span><span class="charoverride5"> For the basic gain and bias equations, transistor behavior was simplified to assume a base-emitter voltage (V</span><span class="charoverride15">BE</span><span class="charoverride5">) of 0.7 V and current gain (</span><span class="charoverride5" xml:lang="ar-SA">β</span><span class="charoverride5">) was assumed to be constant. If you want a more accurate picture of the transistor, particularly at RF, you have to take into account more subtle aspects of how the transistor actually behaves. A good explanation comes from reviewing the models used by simulators — let’s zoom in for another look.</span></p>
<p class="subhead2"><span class="charoverride12">Transistor Models</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">If you look through texts on transistors, you’ll find a number of models that describe BJT behavior — there are a half-dozen in </span><span class="charoverride13">The ARRL Handbook</span><span class="charoverride5">’s chapters on Analog Basics and RF Techniques alone.</span><span class="charoverride14"><a id="ft16" href="part0009_split_004.html#fn16">2</a></span><span class="charoverride5"> Why are there so many, and how do you choose the right one? It depends on how the transistor is to be used. Some models are designed for use at dc and some at very high frequencies.</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">What’s the difference between large- and small-signal models? Large-signal models include behavior of the transistor in the non-linear regions, such as cutoff and saturation, and the effects of dc bias. Small-signal models assume the transistor is biased to operate in its linear region. The linear small-signal model is a lot easier to deal with than the large-signal models for RF applications.</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">The first model you’ll encounter is the very simple “beta generator with emitter resistance” model of Figure 1. The current source in this model replicates the current gain of the transistor, </span><span class="charoverride5" xml:lang="ar-SA">β</span><span class="charoverride5">, since collector current, I</span><span class="charoverride15">C</span><span class="charoverride5"> = </span><span class="charoverride5" xml:lang="ar-SA">β</span><span class="charoverride5">I</span><span class="charoverride15">B</span><span class="charoverride5">. This model works for ordinary dc circuits like relay drivers or on/off switches. It is too simple to be of much use at RF but it does help understand the basic function of the transistor. In general, if a model does not include capacitance, it is intended to be used at dc and low frequencies.</span></p>

<p class="subhead2"><span class="charoverride12">The Hybrid-Pi Model</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">Commonly used at higher frequencies is the </span><span class="charoverride13">hybrid-pi</span><span class="charoverride5"> model that adds a single capacitor, C</span><span class="charoverride15">π</span><span class="charoverride5">, between the base and emitter. BJT construction creates capacitance as discussed below. That capacitance causes high-frequency gain rolloff. Note that the model’s base current, i</span><span class="charoverride15">b</span><span class="charoverride5">, is defined as that going through r</span><span class="charoverride15">e</span><span class="charoverride5"> so that current through C</span><span class="charoverride15">π</span><span class="charoverride5"> does not contribute to the collector current, </span><span class="charoverride5" xml:lang="ar-SA">β</span><span class="charoverride15">0</span><span class="charoverride5">i</span><span class="charoverride15">b</span><span class="charoverride5">. (</span><span class="charoverride5" xml:lang="ar-SA">β</span><span class="charoverride15">0</span><span class="charoverride5"> is the transistor’s low-frequency current gain.) As frequency increases, the reactance of C</span><span class="charoverride15">π</span><span class="charoverride5"> decreases. This reduces the amount of base current entering the transistor that is multiplied by </span><span class="charoverride5" xml:lang="ar-SA">β</span><span class="charoverride15">0</span><span class="charoverride5">, causing gain  to fall.</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">The value of r</span><span class="charoverride15">e</span><span class="charoverride5"> is sometimes replaced by h</span><span class="charoverride15">ie</span><span class="charoverride5">, which is one of the h or hybrid parameters and represents ac input impedance. AC current gain is represented by h</span><span class="charoverride15">fe</span><span class="charoverride5"> and often replaces </span><span class="charoverride5" xml:lang="ar-SA">β</span><span class="charoverride5">.</span><span class="charoverride14"><a id="ft17" href="part0009_split_004.html#fn17">3</a></span></p>
<p class="subhead2"><span class="charoverride12">Dynamic Emitter Resistance</span></p>
<p class="body-text28"><span class="charoverride5">In both of the simple models we’ve looked at so far, you’ll see an internal </span><span class="charoverride13">dynamic emitter resistance</span><span class="charoverride5">, </span><span class="charoverride13">r</span><span class="charoverride20">e</span><span class="charoverride5">, that is dependent on emitter current:</span></p>
<p class="body-text19"><img src="../images/00131.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre24"/></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">This is a characteristic of the transistor itself and should not be confused with an external resistor connected to the emitter which is designated R</span><span class="charoverride15">E</span><span class="charoverride5">. Dynamic emitter resistance represents the change in base-emitter voltage with the change in emitter current. The change in voltage occurs because of the changing characteristics of the base-emitter junction as emitter current increases. </span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">The numerator value of 26 mV is the room-temperature value of </span><span class="charoverride13">kT/q</span><span class="charoverride5">, where k is Boltzmann’s constant, T is temperature in Kelvin, and q is the charge of the electron. At very high or low values of temperature or emitter current, the value of 26 mV will no longer be valid, but for most “normal” situations, it’s close enough.</span></p>
<p class="subhead2"><span class="charoverride12">The Gummel-Poon Model</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">In Figure 3, you see the small-signal ac version of the model originally described by Gummel and Poon of Bell Labs in 1970. The Gummel-Poon model improves on the accuracy of the earlier Ebers-Moll model. This is the standard model used by circuit simulators based on </span><span class="charoverride13">SPICE3</span><span class="charoverride5">, such as </span><span class="charoverride13">LTSpice</span><span class="charoverride5"> that we’ve used in this column previously. With values for all parameters specified by the manufacturer this model can provide accurate results to very high frequencies. The large-signal version of the model also accounts for the variation in current gain with dc current levels. </span></p>
<p class="figure"><img src="../images/00132.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">Figure 4 shows the source of the junction capacitances in the Gummel-Poon model. Figure 4A shows how a planar transistor is actually constructed and Figure 4B gives a more schematic view. Capacitance C</span><span class="charoverride15">B</span><span class="charoverride15">’</span><span class="charoverride15">C</span><span class="charoverride15">’</span><span class="charoverride5">, between the base and collector, is created by the reverse-biased base-collector junction. The junction capacitance of the base-emitter junction is labeled C</span><span class="charoverride15">je</span><span class="charoverride5">. The depletion regions at each junction act as the space between two plates of a capacitor formed by the regions of charge on either side of the junction. This is very similar to a reverse-biased varactor diode with the capacitance controlled by bias voltage that moves the regions of charge closer together or farther apart.</span></p>
<p class="figure"><img src="../images/00133.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">Figure 4B also includes the diffusion capacitance, C</span><span class="charoverride15">diff</span><span class="charoverride5">, which accounts for charge moving through the base-emitter junction when the transistor is biased on. To amplify a signal, that charge must be moved in and out of the junction region, creating the effect of a charge-storing capacitor. C</span><span class="charoverride15">je</span><span class="charoverride5"> and C</span><span class="charoverride15">diff</span><span class="charoverride5"> act together in parallel and are represented by C</span><span class="charoverride15">B</span><span class="charoverride15">’</span><span class="charoverride15">E</span><span class="charoverride15">’</span><span class="charoverride5">, shown in the model and in the hybrid-pi model as C</span><span class="charoverride15">π</span><span class="charoverride5">. (This description oversimplifies the actual behavior of the Gummel-Poon model and is not meant to be an exact treatment.) Both C</span><span class="charoverride15">B</span><span class="charoverride15">’</span><span class="charoverride15">E</span><span class="charoverride15">’</span><span class="charoverride5"> and C</span><span class="charoverride15">B</span><span class="charoverride15">’</span><span class="charoverride15">C</span><span class="charoverride15">’</span><span class="charoverride5"> are on the order of a few pF for most common transistors.</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">Finally, instead of the collector current being modeled with a current gain, the base-emitter junction voltage, V</span><span class="charoverride15">B</span><span class="charoverride15">’</span><span class="charoverride15">E</span><span class="charoverride15">’</span><span class="charoverride5">, is multiplied by the transconductance, g</span><span class="charoverride15">m</span><span class="charoverride5"> which has units of amps/volt. This model is more representative of what’s actually happening in the transistor and results in more accurate behavior compared to real devices. Next month, we’ll experiment with a couple of circuits that demonstrate these effects with real transistors.</span></p>
<p class="subhead2"><span class="charoverride12">Finding Model Values</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">When models weren’t used as widely, the manufacturer data sheets were pretty much the only source for these component values. They aren’t measurable from outside the transistor, except indirectly. The place to look is on the data sheet, in the “Small-Signal Characteristics” section, where you can find input and output capacitance. Today’s manufacturers usually provide </span><span class="charoverride13">SPICE</span><span class="charoverride5"> models on their websites so you can get verified models in minutes!</span></p>
