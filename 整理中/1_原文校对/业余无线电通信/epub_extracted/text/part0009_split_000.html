<p class="experiment-number" id="t1"><span class="charoverride12">Experiment #122 — Battery Characteristics, Part 1</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">This month, we begin a two part article about batteries and battery characteristics with a discussion of what makes batteries “go” and how the different types behave electrically. Next month, we’ll observe the differences for ourselves.</span></p>
<p class="subhead2"><span class="charoverride12">Basic Battery Construction  and Chemistry</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">Viewed simply, the battery is a self-contained chemical reaction vessel in which chemical substances give up electrons that flow through an external circuit to other types of substances that accept electrons. The battery’s </span><span class="charoverride13">separator</span><span class="charoverride5"> keeps the chemicals, well, separated so that the electrons have to make the trip through the circuit to be exchanged. </span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">The electrons do some useful work along the way, converting the chemical energy to electrical energy and then to whatever type of energy the user extracts from the circuit — mechanical, heat, electromagnetic, etc. The reaction continues until all of the available electrons have been exchanged through the external circuit, depleting the chemicals and discharging the battery.</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">The types of atoms or molecules involved in giving up and accepting the electrons — called the </span><span class="charoverride13">battery chemistry</span><span class="charoverride5"> — determine the </span><span class="charoverride13">electromotive force</span><span class="charoverride5"> (EMF) that pushes the electrons through the circuit. Each type of atom or molecule has a certain affinity for electrons: Via a specific chemical reaction, some want to get rid of them and some want to acquire them. The strength of that reaction’s electron exchange is the reaction’s </span><span class="charoverride13">electropotential,</span><span class="charoverride5"> which is measured in volts. The difference in electropotential between the chemicals is what determines the </span><span class="charoverride13">terminal voltage </span><span class="charoverride5">of the battery. (The list of electropotentials for common materials and reactions is also known as the </span><span class="charoverride13">galvanic series</span><span class="charoverride5">.)</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">Batteries are classified in two groups; </span><span class="charoverride13">primary</span><span class="charoverride5"> (non-rechargeable) and </span><span class="charoverride13">secondary</span><span class="charoverride5"> (rechargeable). In both groups, giving up and accepting electrons changes the chemicals into different compounds. (The atoms are still the same types of atoms but the rearrangement of their electrons changes the structure of molecules made from those atoms.) In a </span><span class="charoverride13">primary</span><span class="charoverride5"> battery, the reaction is not reversible even if a voltage is applied externally to make the electrons flow “the other way.” In a </span><span class="charoverride13">secondary</span><span class="charoverride5"> or rechargeable battery, the reaction will run in reverse if powered by an external voltage, restoring the original chemicals and recharging the battery.</span></p>
<p class="subhead2"><span class="charoverride12">Basic Battery Terminology</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">Let’s start with </span><span class="charoverride13">capacity,</span><span class="charoverride5"> which is given in </span><span class="charoverride13">ampere-hours</span><span class="charoverride5"> (</span><span class="charoverride13">Ah</span><span class="charoverride5">). Amperes (coulombs of charge per second) multiplied by time results in an amount of charge. (1 Ah = 1 coulomb/s × 3600 s/h = 3600 coulombs) Thus, capacity measures the number of electrons that a battery can cause to flow through an external circuit. Because capacity is an amount of charge, it is abbreviated C for coulomb. Causing large numbers to flow (high current) discharges a battery’s capacity quickly and low current discharges it slowly.</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">Capacity is independent of terminal voltage: A specific pair of chemicals has the same relative electropotential no matter what quantity of those chemicals is contained in the battery. Thus, terminal voltage is the same for large and small batteries of the same battery chemistry. The larger the quantity of chemicals in the battery, however, the more electrons can be exchanged. </span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">Capacity also indicates the amount of energy stored in a battery. Since the terminal voltage is relatively constant and voltage is joules (J) per coulomb, multiplying capacity times ter- minal voltage yields energy, usually in units of </span><span class="charoverride13">watt-hours</span><span class="charoverride5"> (Wh). For example, a capacity of 2 Ah and a 1.5 V terminal voltage represents 2 Ah × 1.5 V = 3 Wh. (Note that not all of the stored energy can be delivered to the external circuit and that terminal voltage drops as the battery is discharged.)</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">Another important battery characteristic related to its capacity is the battery’s </span><span class="charoverride13">specific energy,</span><span class="charoverride5"> which is given in watt-hours per kilogram (Wh/kg). Batteries with high specific energy store a lot of energy for a given weight. </span></p>




<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">In battery literature, you will also encounter </span><span class="charoverride13">C-rate,</span><span class="charoverride5"> which is the rate at which a battery is charged or discharged measured in terms of its capacity. If a 1000 mAh battery is discharged at a current of 1000 mA, it is being discharged at a rate of 1 C. At 500 mA, the rate is 0.5 C, and at 100 mA the rate is 0.1 C. Because batteries are made in so many different sizes using the same chemistry, C-rate is a useful way to talk about battery performance and maintenance independent of size.</span></p>
<p class="subhead2"><span class="charoverride12">Types of Battery Chemistry	</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">Several battery chemistries account for most needs of the Amateur Radio operator: alka- line, lead-acid, nickel-cadmium (NiCd), nickel-metal hydride (NiMH) and lithium-ion (Li-ion). Table 1 gives the basic characteristics of these battery types.</span><span class="charoverride14"><a id="ft1" href="part0009_split_000.html#fn1">1</a></span><span class="charoverride5"> Alkaline batteries are primary (non-rechargeable) and the rest are secondary (rechargeable). While re-chargeable batteries offer higher specific energies and lower costs over the life of the battery, alkaline batteries do not require a charger, which can be important for emergency situations when ac power is not available. They also have a long shelf life.</span></p>
<p class="figure"><img src="../images/00114.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="subhead2"><span class="charoverride12">Effect of Discharge Rate</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">Table 1 shows peak discharge rates for the various types of batteries in terms of capacity, however, that is not the recommended rate of discharge during normal use. The amount of energy a battery can deliver is maximized at a much lower rate, shown in the row “Best discharge rate” in Table 1. Note that all types of batteries perform best well below the peak discharge rate. Figure 1 shows the effect on a NiCd battery pack’s lifetime at different discharge rates. Other types of batteries are even more strongly affected by discharge rate.</span></p>
<p class="figure"><img src="../images/00115.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="subhead2"><span class="charoverride12">Effect of Depth of Discharge</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">Depth of Discharge (DoD) has a large effect on the number of charge-discharge cycles a battery can provide. The more, or “deeper,” =a battery is discharged, the more it is stressed. Table 2 provides an idea of the effect on a Li-ion battery lifetime when repeatedly discharged to a specific level. Partial discharges preserve battery life.</span></p>
<p class="figure"><img src="../images/00116.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="subhead2"><span class="charoverride12">Effect of Repeated  Charge-Discharge Cycles</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">As most users of rechargeable batteries quickly discover, a battery performs like  new over a number of charge-discharge cycles and then begins to lose capacity. This is due to changes at the microscopic level in the materials of the battery. For example, when a battery is new, the chemicals are typically in the form of very small crystals that provide lots of surface area to exchange electrons. With each cycle, however, the crystals grow in size and that reduces the  total surface area and battery capacity.</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">Figure 2 shows the effect of repeated cycling on the capacity of a set of identical, new 1500 mAh Li-ion batteries. Even though the battery may be able to support hundreds of cycles, after 200 cycles most of the batteries had lost 10% of their initial capacity.</span></p>
<p class="figure"><img src="../images/00117.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="subhead2"><span class="charoverride12">Effect of Temperature</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">Because batteries are based on chemical reactions that vary in rate with temperature, capacity is also affected. For example, a lead-acid battery loses about 10 to 20% of its capacity between room temperature (23</span><span class="charoverride5" xml:lang="ar-SA">°</span><span class="charoverride5"> C) and freezing (0</span><span class="charoverride5" xml:lang="ar-SA">°</span><span class="charoverride5"> C). By –20</span><span class="charoverride5" xml:lang="ar-SA">°</span><span class="charoverride5"> C, about half of the capacity is lost. Thus it is very important for capacity to be measured at a specific temperature when comparing batteries. Automobile and deep cycle batteries have a </span><span class="charoverride13">Cold Cranking Amps</span><span class="charoverride5"> (</span><span class="charoverride13">CCA</span><span class="charoverride5">) rating that must be specified at –18</span><span class="charoverride5" xml:lang="ar-SA">°</span><span class="charoverride5"> C (0</span><span class="charoverride5" xml:lang="ar-SA">°</span><span class="charoverride5"> F) for just this reason.</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">That is not to say that everything gets better with increasing temperature. From </span><span class="charoverride13">Batteries in a Portable World</span><span class="charoverride5">, “The optimum operating temperature for a [lead-acid] battery is 25</span><span class="charoverride5" xml:lang="ar-SA">°</span><span class="charoverride5"> C (77</span><span class="charoverride5" xml:lang="ar-SA">°</span><span class="charoverride5"> F). As a guideline, every 8</span><span class="charoverride5" xml:lang="ar-SA">°</span><span class="charoverride5"> C (15</span><span class="charoverride5" xml:lang="ar-SA">°</span><span class="charoverride5"> F) rise above this temperature cuts battery life in half. At 33</span><span class="charoverride5" xml:lang="ar-SA">°</span><span class="charoverride5"> C (95</span><span class="charoverride5" xml:lang="ar-SA">°</span><span class="charoverride5"> F), that battery’s lifetime is cut in half and is reduced to 10% at 45</span><span class="charoverride5" xml:lang="ar-SA">°</span><span class="charoverride5"> C (107</span><span class="charoverride5" xml:lang="ar-SA">°</span><span class="charoverride5"> F).”</span></p>
<p class="subhead2"><span class="charoverride12">Measuring Battery Performance</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">Next month we are going to both measure some of these effects on actual batteries and introduce you to a new type of voltmeter that has the ability to act as a </span><span class="charoverride13">data logger</span><span class="charoverride5">. Once you realize how useful data logging is, you’ll find all sorts of uses for it in the shack and around your home.</span></p>
