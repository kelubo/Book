<p class="experiment-number1" id="t6"><span class="charoverride12">Experiment #155 — Negative-Voltage Circuits</span></p>
<p class="body-text9"><span class="charoverride5">It may come as a surprise in this 12-volt world, but not every circuit is powered by 13.8 </span><span class="charoverride5" xml:lang="ar-SA">±</span><span class="charoverride5"> 0.5 V dc. Negative voltages were quite common in the days of tubes, but today’s digital logic and analog circuitry mostly requires only one voltage polarity — positive. Is there nothing left “below ground?”</span></p>
<p class="subhead1"><span class="charoverride12">ALC Control</span></p>
<p class="body-text9"><span class="charoverride5">You don’t have very far to look for a circuit that depends on a negative voltage, and that is your radio’s Automatic Level Control (ALC) input. Just like the radio’s internal ALC system, an external amplifier generates an ALC signal to reduce transmitter power and prevent overdrive. The ALC signal is a dc voltage varying from 0 V (full power, no ALC action) to a few volts negative. For example, the ALC range of my TS-590S is 0 to –7 V. Armed with this knowledge, you can turn your 100 W radio into a milli-watter with the simple battery-powered circuit shown in Figure 1. </span></p>
<p class="figure"><img src="../images/00019.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="body-text9"><span class="charoverride5">Set the 1 kΩ pot to about 500 Ω between the wiper and either end of the element. Connect a 9 V battery (paying careful attention to which terminal is positive or negative) across the element of the pot. (You can’t use a ground-referenced power supply for the  9 V battery!) The output ALC signal is created between the wiper of the pot and positive terminal of the battery, which is connected to the radio’s chassis ground. Use a voltmeter to verify that the </span><span class="scbf">ALC_Out</span><span class="charoverride5"> signal is negative and about half of the battery voltage, then adjust the pot for an output of about –0.1 V. The 0.01 </span><span class="charoverride5" xml:lang="ar-SA">μ</span><span class="charoverride5">F capacitor filters out any RF that might be picked up by the connecting cable. </span></p>
<p class="body-text9"><span class="charoverride5">Disconnect the battery and fashion a cable to connect the </span><span class="scbf">ALC_Out</span><span class="charoverride5"> signal to your radio’s ALC input. (This might be a dedicated phono jack, but it’s probably two pins on an accessory connector.) Be sure the positive battery terminal will be connected to the radio’s common or ground pin. Reconnect the battery and turn on the radio. Set the radio for full power output, then generate a steady carrier level into a dummy load. Adjust the pot so that </span><span class="scbf">ALC_Out</span><span class="charoverride5"> becomes more negative and output power from the radio should eventually drop. Generate some CW and adjust the pot until you have 5 W output. </span><span class="charoverride13">Voil</span><span class="charoverride13">à</span><span class="charoverride5"> — you have a QRP rig. Or, you can keep going and see what you can work with 100 mW!</span></p>
<p class="subhead1"><span class="charoverride12">Un-common Emitter</span></p>
<p class="body-text9"><span class="charoverride5">The common emitter (CE) amplifier circuit from “Hands-On Radio” Experiment #1 makes another appearance in Figure 2 —  almost!</span><span class="charoverride14"><a id="ft12" href="part0005_split_005.html#fn12">1</a></span><span class="charoverride5"> Look closely and you’ll see that Q1 is a 2N3906, the PNP twin of the common 2N3904. They have very similar specifications for gain, voltage and current rating, switching speed, etc. You’ll also notice that the battery polarity is inverted so the “top rail” is the circuit’s common.</span></p>
<p class="figure"><img src="../images/00020.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="body-text9"><span class="charoverride5">Everything about this PNP version of the CE is inverted. Instead of pushing current </span><span class="charoverride13">into</span><span class="charoverride5"> the base to turn on the transistor, in this circuit you pull current </span><span class="charoverride13">out</span><span class="charoverride5"> of the base. The more current you allow to flow out of the base (by lowering the value of R1), the more I</span><span class="charoverride15">C</span><span class="charoverride5"> will flow. Even the equations for gain and dc operating point are the same.</span></p>
<p class="body-text9"><span class="charoverride5">Wire up this circuit (use a battery or isolated power supply) and verify that I</span><span class="charoverride15">C</span><span class="charoverride5"> is about  –4 mA and the voltage from collector to emitter, V</span><span class="charoverride15">CE, </span><span class="charoverride5">is about –5 V. (The minus sign for I</span><span class="charoverride15">C</span><span class="charoverride5"> indicates that current is coming </span><span class="charoverride13">out</span><span class="charoverride5"> </span><span class="charoverride13">of</span><span class="charoverride5"> instead of </span><span class="charoverride13">into</span><span class="charoverride5"> the collector.) You can experiment with resistor values to see the effect changing R1 and R2 has on I</span><span class="charoverride15">C</span><span class="charoverride5">. In fact, building both the NPN CE circuit and the PNP CE circuit side by side is a good way to get more comfortable with PNP transistors.</span></p>
<p class="subhead1"><span class="charoverride12">Grid-block Keying</span></p>
<p class="body-text9"><span class="charoverride5">Many of us have electronic keyers that ground our rig’s positive-voltage keying input to turn on the transmitter. What about keying a vacuum tube rig? Many later model tube rigs used </span><span class="charoverride13">grid-block keying</span><span class="charoverride5">, in which a high negative bias voltage (–50 to –150 V) on a tube’s grid cut off plate current during non-transmitting periods. Grounding the negative voltage allowed plate current to flow, turning on the transmitter. This was no problem with a hand key, “bug,” or relay, but today’s solid-state keyers can’t handle negative voltage. What to do?</span></p>
<p class="body-text9"><span class="charoverride5">Chuck Olson, WB9KZY, of Jackson Harbor Press (</span><span class="charoverride12"><a href="http://wb9kzy.com/ham.htm" class="calibre7">wb9kzy.com/ham.htm</a></span><span class="charoverride5">), designed the circuit shown in Figure 3 to adapt the common positive-voltage keyer to grid-block vacuum tube circuits.</span><span class="charoverride14"><a id="ft13" href="part0005_split_005.html#fn13">2</a></span><span class="charoverride5"> In this circuit, the keyer’s output (usually an NPN transistor, as shown) is connected between J1 and J3. To key the tube transmitter, the keyer’s output transistor grounds the base of Q1 through R1, turning on the PNP MJE350, which is rated for the higher grid-block voltage. This connects J2, the radio’s grid-block input, to +5 V, turning on the transmitter. (Voltage at J2 is assumed to be negative.) R2 is a pull-up resistor that keeps the MJE350 turned off when the keyer transistor is off. C1 and D1 protect the transistor from transients and keep RF out of the circuit.</span></p>

<p class="body-text9"><span class="charoverride5"> </span></p>
<p class="subhead1"><span class="charoverride12">Bipolar Op-Amp Circuits</span></p>
<p class="body-text9"><span class="charoverride5">Another place you’ll find a requirement for a negative voltage supply is in op-amp circuits, such as the one shown in Figure 4. This circuit is from “Hands-On Radio” Experiment #3 — a </span><span class="charoverride13">difference amplifier</span><span class="charoverride5"> with an output equal to the difference between V</span><span class="charoverride15">in1</span><span class="charoverride5"> and V</span><span class="charoverride15">in2</span><span class="charoverride5">. (All the resistor values must be equal for this to be true.) While the venerable 741 is shown on the schematic, any common op-amp will do the job at audio frequencies or below. The inputs can be dc, ac, or a combination of the two. It doesn’t matter if both input voltages are positive or negative or which is greater. (Just keep them between the power supply voltages to avoid damaging the op-amp.)</span></p>
<p class="figure"><img src="../images/00022.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="body-text9"><span class="charoverride5">The output can be of either polarity so the power supply must supply both polarities. Figure 4 also shows a handy (and portable) means of generating a negative supply — splitting a set of batteries. A string of  D-cell batteries will supply clean dc power for a long time at the low loads of most circuit experimenting. Use at least four cells for each power supply voltage to generate </span><span class="charoverride5" xml:lang="ar-SA">±</span><span class="charoverride5">6 V. If you have a large multi-cell holder, you can create the circuit’s common voltage by soldering a wire to a bit of brass or copper shim and slipping it between adjacent cells. A pair of surplus rechargeable gel-cell batteries is a good choice, too.</span></p>
<p class="subhead1"><span class="charoverride12">Generating Negative Voltages</span></p>
<p class="body-text9"><span class="charoverride5">Batteries are terrific, but over the long-term, even a small current drain will deplete a good-sized battery. If you have a reliable source of positive voltage you can use a voltage converter IC and a couple of capacitors to create your negative supply instead.</span></p>
<p class="body-text9"><span class="charoverride5">The ICL7660 has been a staple of the analog designer for a long time, along with its many variations. Start by downloading and reading the ICL7660 data sheet from Maxim Integrated.</span><span class="charoverride14"><a id="ft14" href="part0005_split_005.html#fn14">3</a></span><span class="charoverride5"> Not only will you get a detailed description of how the IC works, but also plenty of interesting and innovative ways to use it.</span></p>
<p class="body-text9"><span class="charoverride5">The ICL7660 uses </span><span class="charoverride13">switched-capacitor </span><span class="charoverride5">technology</span><span class="charoverride13"> </span><span class="charoverride5">to convert positive voltages to negative voltages, double a positive voltage, divide voltages, can be connected in series to create higher negative voltages, or connected in parallel to increase the available current.</span></p>
<p class="body-text9"><span class="charoverride5">If you build a simple negative voltage converter, it can be used as the power supply for the ALC power control circuit in Figure 1. Input power can be obtained from the radio’s +12 V supply. Place a Zener diode across the circuit’s output, in parallel with the 0.01 </span><span class="charoverride5" xml:lang="ar-SA">μ</span><span class="charoverride5">F capacitor to limit the output voltage to the maximum for your radio. By packaging the circuit in a simple plastic container or enclosure, you create a handy power-control accessory for your station. Just right for the QRP ARCI’s “1000 Miles Per Watt” award — how low can you go</span><span class="charoverride5">?</span><span class="charoverride14"><a id="ft15" href="part0005_split_005.html#fn15">4</a></span></p>
