<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">Someone just learning electronics first learns Ohm’s Law relating voltage, current, and resistance: </span><span class="charoverride13">R = E / I</span><span class="charoverride5">. The next step is usually to learn how to calculate power: </span><span class="charoverride13">P = E </span><span class="charoverride5">×</span><span class="charoverride13"> I</span><span class="charoverride5">, but this equation must be qualified by the term, “in a resistive circuit.” Inductive and capacitive circuits are somehow different, we learn. Why would inductance and capacitance have anything to do with power?</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">A similar conversation takes place when the terms “reactance” and “impedance” are introduced. Understanding resistance is fairly intuitive — it’s like electrical friction — but this reactance stuff can seem a little odd at first: “Okay, capacitive reactance is like a spring and inductive reactance is like a flywheel. I think I get that. But energy is energy, isn’t it? Why does this affect power, which is </span><span class="charoverride13">E </span><span class="charoverride5">×</span><span class="charoverride13"> I</span><span class="charoverride5">? What is power factor? Phase angle?”</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">Understanding why inductance and capacitance and their abilities to store energy affect the relationship between power and energy can feel like deep water. In this column, we’ll explore these electrical fundamentals.</span></p>
<p class="subhead2"><span class="calibre7">Power at Work</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">Before jumping in, let’s start from solid ground — power and energy in a resistor. When voltage is applied to a resistor, electrons begin to move (i.e. </span><span class="charoverride13">current</span><span class="charoverride5">) through whatever material the resistor is made of; carbon or metal film, nickel-chromium (nichrome) wire, a chunk of metal oxide, etc. The actual speed of the electrons is surprisingly low</span><span class="charoverride14"><a id="ft16" href="part0008_split_006.html#fn16">1</a></span><span class="charoverride5"> but there are an incredible number of them, even in the thinnest conductor. Each electron collides with the atoms making up the conductor and transfers some of its energy to the atom, causing it to vibrate, which is heat. Because the electron moves through the material in response to the applied voltage, the source of the </span><span class="charoverride13">electromotive force</span><span class="charoverride5"> is said to have done </span><span class="charoverride13">work</span><span class="charoverride5"> in the physics sense.</span><span class="charoverride14"><a id="ft17" href="part0008_split_006.html#fn17">2</a></span><span class="charoverride5"> In this case, the work is heating up the material.</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">Work (W) is measured in the same units as energy (joules) and can be thought of as “expended energy.” The rate at which work is performed per unit of time (</span><span class="charoverride13">t</span><span class="charoverride5">) is power: </span><span class="charoverride13">P = W / t</span><span class="charoverride5"> and is measured in watts if </span><span class="charoverride13">t</span><span class="charoverride5"> is measured in seconds. One watt (also abbreviated W) is equal to one joule of work done (or energy expended) per second. Higher power means more work has been done in a specific period of time or that a specific amount of work done in a shorter period of time. What is important is that the electron moves through the material at the same time the voltage is applied.</span></p>
<p class="subhead2"><span class="calibre7">Power and Phase</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">I</span><span class="charoverride5">f the voltage applied to a resistor is a steady value, the resulting </span><span class="charoverride13">direct current </span><span class="charoverride5">(</span><span class="charoverride13">dc</span><span class="charoverride5">) will be a steady value, too. At each moment of time, you can calculate the </span><span class="charoverride13">instantaneous power</span><span class="charoverride5"> by multiplying voltage and current and that, too, will be a steady value. If the applied voltage periodically reverses, creating </span><span class="charoverride13">alternating current </span><span class="charoverride5">(</span><span class="charoverride13">ac</span><span class="charoverride5">), the instantaneous power dissipated by the resistor as heat will also vary. </span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">Figure 1 shows voltage, current, and instantaneous power in an 8 Ω resistor when a 4 V sine wave is applied.</span><span class="charoverride14"><a id="ft18" href="part0008_split_006.html#fn18">3</a></span><span class="charoverride5"> It is important to note that when an ac voltage is applied to a resistor, voltage and current have exactly the same phase; reaching zero, maximum, and minimum at the same time. Instantaneous power (</span><span class="charoverride13">E </span><span class="charoverride5">×</span><span class="charoverride5"> </span><span class="charoverride13">I</span><span class="charoverride5">) in this case is always positive even when both voltage and current are negative to indicate reversal. </span></p>
<p class="figure"><img src="../images/00099.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">What happens if an ac voltage and current are not precisely in phase? First, why wouldn’t they be precisely in phase? Well, if the component in the circuit stores and returns some of the energy instead of dissipating it as heat, that alters the timing between the current and voltage waveforms. For example, if an ac voltage is applied to the </span><span class="charoverride13">capacitive circuit </span><span class="charoverride5">of Figure 2A, the resulting current leads the applied voltage by 90</span><span class="charoverride5" xml:lang="ar-SA">°</span><span class="charoverride5">. (For an explanation, see the “Electrical Fundamentals” chapter of </span><span class="charoverride13">The</span><span class="charoverride5"> </span><span class="charoverride13">ARRL Handbook</span><span class="charoverride5"> or the section “Reactance and Impedance” in the </span><span class="charoverride13">General Class License Manual</span><span class="charoverride5">.</span><span class="charoverride14"><a id="ft19" href="part0008_split_006.html#fn19">4</a>, <a id="ft20" href="part0008_split_006.html#fn20">5</a>, <a id="ft21" href="part0008_split_006.html#fn21">6</a></span><span class="charoverride5">) </span></p>
<p class="figure"><img src="../images/00100.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">Instead of instantaneous power always being positive as in the resistive circuit, it is positive for half the cycle (0</span><span class="charoverride5" xml:lang="ar-SA">°</span><span class="charoverride5"> to 90° and 180° to 270°) and negative for the remaining half-cycle. When we add up instantaneous power throughout the cycle, the result is zero and no net work has been done at all! Figure 2B shows the complementary situation for an </span><span class="charoverride13">inductive circuit</span><span class="charoverride5"> — the net result is the same. If total work is zero, then total power is also zero and no energy has been consumed. </span></p>
<p class="subhead2"><span class="calibre7">Minding the Ps and Qs</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5"> “But, but, but…” I hear you exclaim, “sure, total power is zero over the whole cycle but during half the cycle, power is being consumed! What happened to that power?” An excellent question! During the positive power half-cycle, energy is not being consumed or dissipated, it is being stored in an electric field (for a capacitor) or in a magnetic field (for an inductor). During the negative-power half-cycles, energy is returned to the source.</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">Power for which the voltage and current are in phase is called </span><span class="charoverride13">real power</span><span class="charoverride5"> because the power does “real work” and is not stored or returned. Real power is labeled </span><span class="charoverride13">P</span><span class="charoverride5"> and is measured in watts. Power for which the voltage and current are 90</span><span class="charoverride5" xml:lang="ar-SA">°</span><span class="charoverride5"> out of phase (see Figure 2) is called </span><span class="charoverride13">reactive power</span><span class="charoverride5"> because of the reactance creating the phase shift. Reactive power is labeled </span><span class="charoverride13">Q</span><span class="charoverride5"> and is measured in </span><span class="charoverride13">volt-amperes reactive </span><span class="charoverride5">or </span><span class="charoverride13">VAR</span><span class="charoverride5">. </span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">If a circuit contains both resistance and reactance, also called a </span><span class="charoverride13">reactive load</span><span class="charoverride5">, the resulting instantaneous power waveform is made up of both real and reactive power. Figure 3 uses complex numbers to show the relationship between real and reactive power in such a circuit. Q is drawn parallel to +90</span><span class="charoverride5" xml:lang="ar-SA">°</span><span class="charoverride5"> imaginary axis if the reactance is inductive (as in Figure 3) or at –90</span><span class="charoverride5" xml:lang="ar-SA">°</span><span class="charoverride5"> if the reactance is capacitive.</span></p>
<p class="figure"><img src="../images/00101.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">The addition of the values for real (P) and reactive power (Q) results in the complex number </span><span class="charoverride13">S</span><span class="charoverride5"> = </span><span class="charoverride13">P + jQ</span><span class="charoverride5">, representing </span><span class="charoverride13">complex power.</span><span class="charoverride5"> The magnitude of complex power, |S| = </span><span class="charoverride29">√</span><span class="charoverride5">P</span><span class="charoverride14">2</span><span class="charoverride5"> + Q</span><span class="charoverride14">2</span><span class="charoverride5"> is called </span><span class="charoverride13">apparent power</span><span class="charoverride5">, which is measured in </span><span class="charoverride13">volt-amperes</span><span class="charoverride5"> or </span><span class="charoverride13">VA</span><span class="charoverride5">. Apparent power is also equal to the magnitude of the voltage and current measured separately and multiplied together without regard for phase differences. </span></p>
<p class="subhead2"><span class="calibre7">Power Factor and Phase Angle</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">We’ve finally arrived in the deep water! The </span><span class="charoverride13">phase angle</span><span class="charoverride5">,</span><span class="charoverride5"> </span><span class="charoverride5">θ</span><span class="charoverride5" xml:lang="ar-SA">,</span><span class="charoverride5"> from </span><span class="charoverride13">P</span><span class="charoverride5"> to </span><span class="charoverride13">S</span><span class="charoverride5"> is the amount of phase difference between the applied voltage and the resulting current in the circuit. </span><span class="charoverride13">Power factor, PF,</span><span class="charoverride5"> is the cosine of the phase angle, </span><span class="charoverride5">θ</span><span class="charoverride5">, and so is always in the range of 0 to 1.</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">A PF of 1 means the voltage and current are exactly in phase and all power is real power. PF becomes gradually smaller as Q increases, eventually reaching 0 when all of the power is Q with no P. It doesn’t matter whether Q is inductive (</span><span class="charoverride5">θ</span><span class="charoverride5"> &gt; 0) or capacitive (</span><span class="charoverride5">θ</span><span class="charoverride5" xml:lang="ar-SA"> </span><span class="charoverride5">&lt; 0) because the cosine of </span><span class="charoverride5">θ</span><span class="charoverride5"> is the same for positive and negative angles.</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">Power system engineers use PF to specify how much reactive power is present in a particular circuit and they prefer PF to be close to 1. Why? If PF gets smaller for a given amount of real power, P, that means reactive power, Q, must be increasing. Oversimplifying somewhat, that means more volts and amps are dedicated to reactive power and not doing any real work. Those reactive volts and amps stress insulation and cause heating from I</span><span class="charoverride14">2</span><span class="charoverride5">R losses so wires have to be bigger and insulation thicker. Keeping PF close to 1 minimizes the bad effects of Q while the power system delivers the required amount of P to customers. </span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">This might be starting to sound familiar to hams. RF designers use </span><span class="charoverride5">θ</span><span class="charoverride5" xml:lang="ar-SA"> </span><span class="charoverride5">when calculating impedances and designing matching circuits to make your transmitter happy with a 50 + </span><span class="charoverride13">j </span><span class="charoverride5">0 Ω impedance — just another way of saying PF = 1 and </span><span class="charoverride5">θ</span><span class="charoverride5" xml:lang="ar-SA"> </span><span class="charoverride5">= 0</span><span class="charoverride5" xml:lang="ar-SA">°</span><span class="charoverride5">! So you see, power factor and phase angle are just another way of discussing the relationship between voltage and current in an ac circuit, whether at 60 Hz or in our RF bands.</span></p>
