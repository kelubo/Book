<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">On our MF and lower HF bands, the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is dominated by galactic noise from 15 to 30 MHz at night by atmospheric noise from storms and man-made sources below 15 MHz. </span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">The type of noise we are mostly concerned with in sensitive RF receiving systems is </span><span class="charoverride13">thermal noise</span><span class="charoverride5">, also called </span><span class="charoverride13">Johnson-Nyquist noise</span><span class="charoverride5">. There are many other types of noise — shot noise, flicker noise, and even popcorn noise — that are generated inside our electronic devices. From the external world, atmospheric noise is accompanied at VHF and above by galactic noise and sun noise.</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">Thermal noise is generated in all conducting materials by the random vibration of free electrons due to their thermal energy. The higher the material’s temperature, the larger the vibrations of the free electrons become. This motion of charge creates a </span><span class="charoverride13">noise voltage</span><span class="charoverride5"> in any conductor not at absolute zero.</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">Based on material</span><span class="charoverride14"><a id="ft22" href="part0008_split_007.html#fn22">1</a></span><span class="charoverride5"> by Paul Wade, W1GHZ, in </span><span class="charoverride13">The ARRL Handbook</span><span class="charoverride5">, the basics of thermal noise are as follows: Every resistance (and all conductors have resistance) generates a root-mean-square (RMS) noise voltage:</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride13">e = </span><span class="charoverride5">√</span><span class="charoverride5">4</span><span class="charoverride13">kTRB</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">where </span><span class="charoverride13">k</span><span class="charoverride5"> is Boltzmann’s constant (1.38 × 10</span><span class="charoverride14">–23</span><span class="charoverride5"> joules / K), </span><span class="charoverride13">T</span><span class="charoverride5"> is the absolute temperature in kelvin (K, which is equal to the temperature in Celsius plus 273), </span><span class="charoverride13">R</span><span class="charoverride5"> is the resistance, and </span><span class="charoverride13">B</span><span class="charoverride5"> is the bandwidth in hertz. Converting to power, </span><span class="charoverride13">e</span><span class="charoverride21">2</span><span class="charoverride13"> / 4R</span><span class="charoverride5">, the noise power generated by the resistor is: </span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride13">P</span><span class="charoverride20">n</span><span class="charoverride13"> = kTB </span><span class="charoverride5">(watts)</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">This independence of frequency is why thermal noise is called </span><span class="charoverride13">white noise</span><span class="charoverride5"> and has a power that depends only on temperature.</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">Note that all resistances at the same temperature generate the same noise power. Similarly, if two noise sources generate the same power in the same bandwidth, they are said to have the same </span><span class="charoverride13">noise temperature</span><span class="charoverride5">,</span><span class="charoverride13"> T</span><span class="charoverride20">n</span><span class="charoverride5">. This is the temperature at which a resistor at the same temperature would generate the same noise power as the source, whether it is an electronic circuit, a cable, or an antenna. </span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">The amount of power per unit of bandwidth is called </span><span class="charoverride13">power density</span><span class="charoverride5"> or </span><span class="charoverride13">spectral density</span><span class="charoverride5"> and is equal to </span><span class="charoverride13">kT</span><span class="charoverride5"> watts  per Hz. Because power is proportional to the square of voltage, the corresponding </span><span class="charoverride13">voltage density</span><span class="charoverride5"> or </span><span class="charoverride13">spectral density</span><span class="charoverride5"> is measured in volts / √Hz, spoken as “volts per root hertz.” </span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">Calculating noise power density at 290 K (290 K = 16.9</span><span class="charoverride5" xml:lang="ar-SA">°</span><span class="charoverride5">C = 62.6</span><span class="charoverride5" xml:lang="ar-SA">°</span><span class="charoverride5">F) gives:</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride13">P</span><span class="charoverride20">n</span><span class="charoverride13"> </span><span class="charoverride5">=  (1.38 × 10</span><span class="charoverride14">–23</span><span class="charoverride5"> × 290) </span><span class="charoverride13">B</span><span class="charoverride5"> = 400 × 10</span><span class="charoverride14">–23</span><span class="charoverride5"> </span><span class="charoverride13">B</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">Multiply by the bandwidth in hertz to get the available noise power at 290 K. The choice of 290 K is simply for convenient calculations because </span><span class="charoverride13">P</span><span class="charoverride20">n</span><span class="charoverride5"> is 400 </span><span class="charoverride13">B</span><span class="charoverride5"> at that temperature. Converting to dBm by calculating  10 log(</span><span class="charoverride13">P</span><span class="charoverride20">n</span><span class="charoverride5">), we get –174 dBm / Hz. </span></p>

<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">Continuing to build on W1GHZ’s material in </span><span class="charoverride13">The ARRL Handbook</span><span class="charoverride5">, all amplifiers add additional noise to the noise present at their input. The input noise per unit of bandwidth is </span><span class="charoverride13">N</span><span class="charoverride20">i</span><span class="charoverride13"> = kT</span><span class="charoverride20">g</span><span class="charoverride5">, where </span><span class="charoverride13">T</span><span class="charoverride20">g</span><span class="charoverride5"> is the noise temperature at the amplifier’s input. Amplified by power gain, </span><span class="charoverride13">G</span><span class="charoverride5">, the output noise power is </span><span class="charoverride13">kT</span><span class="charoverride20">g</span><span class="charoverride13">G</span><span class="charoverride5">. The noise power added by the amplifier, </span><span class="charoverride13">kT</span><span class="charoverride15">n</span><span class="charoverride5">, is then added to the amplified input noise to produce a total output noise, </span><span class="charoverride13">N</span><span class="charoverride20">o</span><span class="charoverride13"> = kT</span><span class="charoverride20">g</span><span class="charoverride13">G + kT</span><span class="charoverride20">n</span><span class="charoverride13"> = k(T</span><span class="charoverride20">g</span><span class="charoverride13">G + T</span><span class="charoverride20">n</span><span class="charoverride13">)</span><span class="charoverride5">.</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">We can model the amplifier as ideal and noise-free and add a noise-generating resistor of temperature </span><span class="charoverride13">T</span><span class="charoverride20">e</span><span class="charoverride13"> = T</span><span class="charoverride20">n</span><span class="charoverride13"> / G</span><span class="charoverride5"> at the input. In this way, all sources of noise can be treated as inputs to the amplifier, as illustrated by Figure 1. Substituting for </span><span class="charoverride13">T</span><span class="charoverride20">n</span><span class="charoverride5"> in the previous equation, the output noise is then  </span><span class="charoverride13">N</span><span class="charoverride20">o</span><span class="charoverride13"> = kG (T</span><span class="charoverride20">g</span><span class="charoverride13"> + T</span><span class="charoverride20">e</span><span class="charoverride13">)</span><span class="charoverride5">.</span></p>
<p class="figure"><img src="../images/00102.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">The noise added by an amplifier can then be represented as </span><span class="charoverride13">kGT</span><span class="charoverride20">e</span><span class="charoverride5">, which is the amplifier’s noise temperature amplified by the amplifier’s gain. </span><span class="charoverride13">T</span><span class="charoverride20">e</span><span class="charoverride5"> is sometimes referred to as </span><span class="charoverride13">excess temperature</span><span class="charoverride5">. </span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">Because amplifiers have many different values of gain, there needs to be a way to compare their noise performance without a bunch of calculations. The answer is </span><span class="charoverride13">noise factor</span><span class="charoverride5"> and </span><span class="charoverride13">noise figure</span><span class="charoverride5">.</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">The noise factor </span><span class="charoverride13">F</span><span class="charoverride5"> of an amplifier is the ratio of the total noise output of an amplifier with an input </span><span class="charoverride13">T</span><span class="charoverride20">g</span><span class="charoverride5"> of 290 K to the noise output of an equivalent noise-free amplifier. The easiest way to do this is to use noise temperatures: </span><span class="charoverride13">F = </span><span class="charoverride5">1</span><span class="charoverride13"> + T</span><span class="charoverride20">e</span><span class="charoverride13"> / T</span><span class="charoverride20">g</span><span class="charoverride5">. It is often more convenient to work with </span><span class="charoverride13">noise figure</span><span class="charoverride5">, </span><span class="charoverride13">NF</span><span class="charoverride5">, the logarithm of noise factor expressed in dB: </span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride13">NF = </span><span class="charoverride5">10 log</span><span class="charoverride13">F </span><span class="charoverride5">and</span><span class="charoverride13"> F = </span><span class="charoverride5">log</span><span class="charoverride14">–1</span><span class="charoverride5">(</span><span class="charoverride13">NF / </span><span class="charoverride5">10)</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">If the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in decibels is known at the input and output: </span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride13">NF = SNR</span><span class="charoverride20">in</span><span class="charoverride13"> – SNR</span><span class="charoverride20">out</span><span class="charoverride13"> </span><span class="charoverride5">or</span><span class="charoverride13"> SNR</span><span class="charoverride20">out</span><span class="charoverride13"> = SNR</span><span class="charoverride20">in</span><span class="charoverride13"> – NF</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">Noise figure is sometimes stated as </span><span class="charoverride13">input noise figure</span><span class="charoverride5"> to emphasize that all noise sources and noise contributions are converted to an equivalent set of noise sources at the input of a noiseless device. In this way, noise performance can be compared on equal terms across a wide variety of devices. It also makes comparing their relative contributions to output noise much easier. </span></p>
<p class="subhead2"><span class="calibre7">Location, Location, Location</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">When more than one noise-generating component is connected in series or cascade, they all contribute differently to the overall output noise level and SNR. Even a simple receiving system consists of three such components — antenna, feed line, and receiver — with each adding to, or even amplifying, the noise at its input. The </span><span class="charoverride13">Friis equation</span><span class="charoverride5"> takes into account the gain or loss of each component and gives an overall </span><span class="charoverride13">system noise factor</span><span class="charoverride5"> for N devices connected in series.</span></p>
<p class="body-text19"><img src="../images/00103.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre20"/></p>
<p class="body-text26"><img src="../images/00104.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre21"/></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">where device 1 is the one at the input to the system. Clearly, if the gain of the first stage, </span><span class="charoverride13">G</span><span class="charoverride15">1</span><span class="charoverride5">, is large, then the noise contributions of the succeeding stages become too small to be significant. In addition, the noise temperature of the first stage is the largest contributor to the overall system noise because it is amplified by all remaining stages.</span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">The important thing to learn from the Friis equation is that noise-reduction efforts should be made at the input to the system. A good example is the question of where to put a preamp in an antenna system. Figure 2 shows the difference between placing the preamp at the input to a lossy feed line and placing it at the receiver input.</span></p>
<p class="figure"><img src="../images/00105.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">You can hear the Friis equation in action with a simple experiment using a VHF or UHF FM transceiver, a long length of coax or an attenuator, and a preamplifier.</span><span class="charoverride14"><a id="ft23" href="part0008_split_007.html#fn23">2</a>,</span><span class="charoverride14"> </span><span class="charoverride14"><a id="ft24" href="part0008_split_007.html#fn24">3</a>,</span><span class="charoverride14"> </span><span class="charoverride14"><a id="ft25" href="part0008_split_007.html#fn25">4</a></span><span class="charoverride5"> </span></p>
<p class="body-text18"><span class="charoverride5">Choose some coax with about  3 – 6 dB of loss — 100 feet of RG-58 or RG-8X will do nicely at VHF or UHF. Connect the coax between a small antenna and your transceiver, then tune in a weak (distant) repeater, which is received with a noisy signal at your location. (If you use an attenuator, just add attenuation until a local repeater signal becomes noisy.) Add the preamp at the antenna and observe how much the SNR improves. Then move it to the other end of the coax, connecting it directly to the transceiver input, and observe SNR again. You will find that placing the high-gain preamp closer to the input of your receiving system results in a better SNR.</span></p>
