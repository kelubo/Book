  <h1 class="block_8" id="toc_id_15">Being Prepared</h1>

  <p class="block_14"><br class="calibre7"/>If you want to get the most out of your scene, you&#8217;ll need to do more than just choose a good partner. You&#8217;ll need to do your part, which includes preparing, mentally and physically. That&#8217;s why Helpful Skill No. 2 is Being Prepared.</p>

  <p class="block_15">Many of the videos and photos of rope scenes you&#8217;ll see, especially with suspensions, show thin, young, bendy types. If you don&#8217;t fit that mold (I certainly don&#8217;t), for heaven&#8217;s sake do not think you can&#8217;t get tied up. I&#8217;ve seen all kinds of people do all kinds of rope scenes, even including suspensions, very successfully: muscular people, people with a BMI much higher than average, older people, people who can&#8217;t touch their toes. I had a very low pain tolerance and was not particularly flexible when I did my first suspension at age 41.</p>

  <p class="block_20"><span class="text_22">Pretty much anyone can do </span><span class="text_23">some</span><span class="text_22"> kind of rope play, barring any serious medical or physical condition that dictates otherwise. If you&#8217;re concerned about what you should and shouldn&#8217;t attempt, please consult a medical professional. (For suspensions, see &#8220;</span><a class="text_43" href="http://www.remedialropes.com/bondage-safety-articles/bdsm-bullshit-who-can-be-suspended/">BDSM Bullshit: Who Can Be Suspended?</a><span class="text_22">&#8221; in the Articles section on </span><a href="http://www.remedialropes.com/" class="calibre8"><span class="text_22">RemedialRopes.com</span></a><span class="text_22">.) But don&#8217;t let what you see in photos and videos discourage you.</span></p>

  <p class="block_15">Having said that, being fit and somewhat flexible will expand the possibilities of what you&#8217;re able to do. Being able to calm the chatter in your head will allow you to drop in and be fully present in the scene. Taking care of your physical needs (going to the bathroom, satisfying hunger and thirst, identifying injuries and sore spots) will let you focus on the experience more completely. Let&#8217;s break it down.</p>

  <h2 class="block_35" id="toc_id_16"><span class="text_25"><br class="calibre7"/></span><span class="text_50" id="id_yourhead">Mental Preparation</span></h2>

  <p class="block_14">Being tied up is an act of surrender, I believe, both to your partner and to the experience. Surrender comes to some easily, to some not easily at all, and at every degree in between. Maybe you need the &#8220;fight&#8221; wrestled out of you first, and you like to psych yourself up for the wrestling by listening to heavy metal music. Maybe you&#8217;re eagerly longing to hand over the control reins to someone else after a long day at a high-powered job, and soothing music and a bubble bath will help you ease into that transition. Whatever helps you get into the state of mind of surrender can be beneficial.</p>

  <p class="block_15">Even very athletic suspensions with very empowered rope bottoms are, in my opinion, an act of submission. Because even if you have practiced a suspension with your partner many times, and you both identify as equal partners in the scene, you will still need to deal with the pain, the uncertainty, maybe even a moment or two of panic (&#8220;What the hell was I thinking? Why didn&#8217;t I just stay in my nice, safe bed?&#8221;). If getting tied up were as easy and certain as a walk on the treadmill, it wouldn&#8217;t be much fun, would it? The fear, the uncertainty, the rush, the sense of accomplishment—all of those feelings can contribute to an incredible scene, and all of those require certain amounts of submission on the bottom&#8217;s part.</p>

  <p class="block_15">So I believe that whatever you can do to feel confident and safe enough to surrender, and to otherwise be in the right headspace, will go a long way toward creating a fulfilling scene. My mental preparation includes telling my inner critic to shut up—the one who sneers that I&#8217;m too old, too out of shape, too inflexible or otherwise too incapable to do the scene. I remind myself of the really intense scenes I&#8217;ve done, like the suspension 12 feet off the concrete floor when I spat in the face of my fear of heights. I also remind myself that no matter how intense, challenging or even downright painful the scene will be, I can probably look forward to that blissful sense of transcendence and the complete mental and physical letting go that, for me, is sub space.</p>

  <p class="block_15">Figure out your own version of a pep talk to yourself and don&#8217;t be too embarrassed to use it. </p>

  <p class="block_15">Then there is overall mental health. I&#8217;m not going to discuss whether people who get tied up or engage in any other BDSM practice are more or less mentally healthy than the average person, because it&#8217;s irrelevant for our purposes here. You want to get tied up; I want to get tied up; and our goal is to do it safely and enjoyably. But I do urge you to honestly examine your reasons for wanting to be tied up, and if your instinct is telling you that you&#8217;re using rope play to re-live damaging incidents or re-create old wounds, please strongly consider getting help from a mental health professional. Rope play, like any other BDSM practice, can be therapeutic, but if you are using it as a replacement for professional therapy, you&#8217;re doing both yourself and your partner a disservice—and you&#8217;ll likely find it is not very effective for that goal anyway.</p>

  <p class="block_15">The last part of mental preparation is letting go of expectations for the scene. Every scene has its own flavor, and although having a general <i class="calibre11">intention</i> can be beneficial—for example, &#8220;I want to connect with my partner&#8221; or &#8220;I want to expand my boundaries&#8221;—having specific expectations is, as mentioned, a recipe for disappointment. Why? Because 1. There are too many factors you can&#8217;t control—your partner&#8217;s needs, style, and mood; the weather; the kind of day you both had; etc. and 2. If you&#8217;re trying to dictate how the scene goes, then you aren&#8217;t really surrendering to your partner or the experience, and you won&#8217;t get all the lovely benefits of surrendering, like sub space.</p>

  <p class="block_15">Please remember also that <i class="calibre11">rope tops are not vending machines,</i> there to serve up your fantasies with the push of a button. You both have your own needs and desires, and for a scene to be fulfilling for both of you, both of your needs have to be met. Even if your need is for absolute objectification or submitting completely to your partner&#8217;s wishes through consensual nonconsent, that&#8217;s still a need. Your rope top has them too. Treat your partner with the courtesy, consideration, and respect they deserve, and never take for granted the experience they&#8217;re helping create for both of you.</p>

  <h2 class="block_35" id="toc_id_17"><span class="text_25"><br class="calibre7"/></span><span class="text_50" id="id_yourbody">Physical Preparation</span></h2>

  <p class="block_36"><span class="text_22">There is such a wide range of rope scene types, as we&#8217;ve discussed, and obviously the intensity of the scene will determine how much physical preparation you&#8217;ll want to do. You&#8217;ll find detailed recommendations for suspensions in </span><a class="calibre8"><span class="text_22">Chapter 10</span></a><span class="text_22">, but for even the least intense scene, I recommend that you:</span></p>

  <p class="block_14"><br class="calibre7"/>• Eat something beforehand, but don&#8217;t stuff yourself. You want to be delirious from bliss, not hunger. But when that rope coils around your stomach, you also don&#8217;t want it to be squishing a stomach full of meatball hero.</p>

  <p class="block_14"><br class="calibre7"/>• Stay hydrated, but don&#8217;t drink so much that you need to hit the bathroom every 15 minutes.</p>

  <p class="block_14"><br class="calibre7"/>• Pee right before, even if you just went 30 minutes ago. When you&#8217;re feeling that lovely vibration of rope running across your skin is not the time to be hearing the call of nature.</p>

  <p class="block_14"><br class="calibre7"/>• Avoid heavy perfume or cologne. Everyone&#8217;s taste in scents is different. I know rope tops who won&#8217;t tie certain people because of their fragrances, and I don&#8217;t get tied up by people whose fragrances turn me off.</p>

  <p class="block_36"><span class="text_22">• Stretch. Light stretching for light scenes; deeper stretching for more intense or prolonged scenes, especially suspensions. You&#8217;ll find a list of the stretches I do in </span><a class="calibre8"><span class="text_22">Chapter 9</span></a><span class="text_22">.</span></p>

  <p class="block_14"><br class="calibre7"/>• Check in with your body. Do you have any injuries, old or recent? Is anything strained or hurting on this particular day? Let your rope top know.</p>

  <p class="block_36"><span class="text_22"><br class="calibre7"/>• Spend at least a couple of minutes cultivating mindfulness, as discussed in </span><a class="text_43">Chapter 2</a><span class="text_22">. </span></p>

  <p class="block_24" id="toc_1"><span class="text_32"><br class="calibre7"/></span><span class="text_33" id="id_yourbag">Your Rope Bottoming Bag</span><span class="text_32"><br class="calibre7"/></span></p>

  <p class="block_36"><span class="text_22">It can also be a good idea to pack a rope bottoming bag. Again, what&#8217;s in it will depend on the intensity of your scene. If your scene will be very light and your rope top is well prepared, you might not need anything at all. If your scene will be more intense, you may want to include:</span></p>

  <p class="block_14"><br class="calibre7"/>• Any medications, inhalers, EpiPens or other items you may need in case of a medical emergency</p>

  <p class="block_14"><br class="calibre7"/>• A hair tie if you have long hair</p>

  <p class="block_14"><br class="calibre7"/>• A warm and snuggly sweater or scarf, or even a towel</p>

  <p class="block_14"><br class="calibre7"/>• Water and a nonperishable snack, like trail mix or a Clif bar</p>

  <p class="block_14"><br class="calibre7"/>• Flats (some clubs have a must-wear-shoes rule, and you might tire of those 6-inch stilettos or stompy boots)</p>

  <p class="block_14"><br class="calibre7"/>• Arnica gel or cream (available at major drugstores; considered good for muscle soreness and bruising), acetaminophen (like Tylenol), and/or an NSAID (like Advil, Motrin, or Aleve). Some people also take arnica tablets orally.</p>

  <p class="block_14">• Hand sanitizer (for after your scene and before your snack if, for example, you&#8217;ve been pawing a dirty floor)</p>

  <p class="block_14"><br class="calibre7"/>• Eye rewetting drops (maybe you cum so hard your eyeballs dry out, or you wear contact lenses)</p>

  <p class="block_14"><br class="calibre7"/>• Comfy clothes to change into afterward. Maybe an extra pair of undies too. </p>

  <p class="block_14"><br class="calibre7"/>Some rope bottoms also like to bring their own safety shears, which are used for cutting the rope in emergency situations. I don&#8217;t, because I would never let anyone tie me up who is negligent or forgetful enough not to bring their own safety shears. </p>

  <p class="block_20"><span class="text_22">For the days after the scene, Tiger Balm, arnica gel or cream, and magnesium oil can help with muscles soreness; magnesium oil can be itchy or stingy when you first put it on, but that sensation goes away pretty quickly. Magnesium is great for muscle relaxation in general and comes in the form of Epsom salts (magnesium sulfate) for the bath too. Clover has posted that she likes to have Bio-Oil and Palmer&#8217;s cream for rope marks in her </span><a class="text_43" href="http://kinkyclover.com/my-rope-bottoming-essential-kit/">rope bottoming kit</a><span class="text_22"> too.</span></p>

  <h2 class="block_25" id="toc_id_18"><br class="calibre7"/>Clothing</h2>

  <p class="block_14">You can do rope in anything from your birthday suit to an evening gown, but keep the nature of your scene in mind and also be mindful of anything that compresses the chest or diaphragm or otherwise restricts your breathing, like a corset, hood, or gag. Avoid underwire bras as well if there will be rope on the chest, especially for suspensions.</p>

  <p class="block_14">I usually like to err on the side of being comfortable in clothes and spend my pain bank on the rope and any impact toys used instead. </p>

  <p class="block_27">~</p>

  <h2 class="block_25" id="toc_id_19">True Story</h2>

  <p class="block_14">I once did a paid bondage performance at a party. It was a last-minute invitation, and neither the rope top nor I knew exactly what to expect. We had initially discussed light bondage, but once there we decided to do a suspension instead. No nudity was allowed, so I traded my dress for Saran wrap wound around my breasts. It felt snug, but I thought I could breathe fine. Sure, on the ground. Ten seconds into an inversion, the edges of my vision went wavy and I saw stars. I pulled myself up, took some deep breaths, and tried again. Ten more seconds back in it and I was 5 seconds away from blacking out. </p>

  <p class="block_15">The rope top had me out of the rope in less than 30 seconds, and I didn&#8217;t pass out. He sat me down with my head between my legs and was very reassuring, and we did come back later that night with a successful suspension, but at the time I felt like a failure. There are a lot of lessons to be learned here, but the most important one is: The wrong clothing can ruin your scene. Err on the side of being comfortable and able to breathe well.<span id="id_Fifthsection" class="calibre10"><br class="calibre5" id="calibre_pb_9"/>
