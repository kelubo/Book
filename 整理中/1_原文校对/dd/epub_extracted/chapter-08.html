  <h1 class="block_8" id="toc_id_36">Making a Connection</h1>

  <p class="block_16"><span class="text_28"><br class="calibre7"/></span><span class="text_14">Connection is a particularly hot topic in the San Francisco Bay Area rope community as I write this, and I think my good friends Kanso and True_Blue of Bondage Erotique, as well as instructors coming to teach here from overseas, like Peter Slemrian of Denmark, have had a lot to do with it. But even if it weren&#8217;t a buzzword right now, making a connection would deserve a spot on the Helpful Skills list. In fact, I believe it&#8217;s a skill </span><span class="text_45">every</span><span class="text_14"> bottom, not just rope bottoms, can benefit from.</span></p>

  <p class="block_15">Maybe sometimes you&#8217;ll just want your rope or pain fix and call it a day. Nothing wrong with that. But if you and your partner are just using each other to get rope-high needs or pain-receiving/pain-giving needs met all the time, you&#8217;re missing out on one of the big benefits of doing what it is we do: feeling the intimacy of meeting another person in a place where your everyday masks are off.</p>

  <p class="block_15">For me, this type of connection, this intimacy, is what can change rope play from mere pleasure to transcendence. And, as with all aspects of rope, there&#8217;s a scale. There are the small connections and intimacies, like hearing the rope top&#8217;s unexpected gasp of pleasure or seeing the sweat dripping from their brow or pooling in their back, or feeling their breath on your neck. There&#8217;s the way their face looks when they&#8217;re standing 3 feet away and gazing at you adoringly all tied up in their handiwork. There&#8217;s that deep connection of feeling them inside you when you&#8217;re completely immobilized in rope and at their mercy. </p>

  <p class="block_15">For some, making a connection happens through the physical, through their partner&#8217;s sensuous caresses or kisses or spanks or slaps. For others, it can be completely energetic, with no touching other than to apply the ropes. To feel connected with your partner, first you have to know what kinds of things will make you feel connected, and there is no single answer; you&#8217;ll have to figure it out for yourself. </p>

  <p class="block_15">I do a lot of rope play as a way of getting to know someone, instead of getting to know the person and then exploring rope together. So I often find myself half-naked and tied up with someone who is basically a stranger, which can make for some very surreal &#8220;What the hell am I doing?&#8221; moments. But it&#8217;s part of the turn-on for me, the challenge of creating intimacy with someone I&#8217;ve just met. Here are some things I do to connect that might help you too.</p>

  <h2 class="block_35" id="toc_id_37"><span class="text_25"><br class="calibre7"/></span><span class="text_50" id="id_reach">Ways to Foster a Connection</span></h2>

  <p class="block_24"><span class="text_33">Allow yourself to be vulnerable.</span><span class="text_49"> </span><span class="text_17">For someone to connect with you, they have to see </span><span class="text_16">you</span><span class="text_17">. Not the perfect rope bottom in your imagination but the real you. Let your emotional guard down. Giggle or laugh or whimper or cry. Tell them you&#8217;re scared or nervous. Let those moans of pleasure out of their cage. Nuzzle your partner&#8217;s neck if they get close enough, or lean against them a little. Be brave. Rope tying is a dance, and wallflowers don&#8217;t have much fun.</span></p>

  <p class="block_24"><span class="text_33">Look for your rope top&#8217;s humanness.</span><span class="text_32"> </span><span class="text_17">Same concept as above. For you to feel connected with your rope top, you have to see </span><span class="text_16">them</span><span class="text_17"> for who they are in the moment. Not the person who executed some complicated concept for a photo shoot, not the instructor who has rope bottoms from here to kingdom come begging to be tied, not the person who may have taken out the trash that morning.</span></p>

  <p class="block_15">Sweat is so sexy to me because it&#8217;s both a visual symbol of the effort the rope top is putting in to make a pleasurable experience for us, and because it&#8217;s something most people are embarrassed about—sweating is an act of vulnerability. Ditto the sounds they might make—grunts or groans or sighs. Look for those little signs that your rope top is present and unique, and celebrate them. They&#8217;re like little bluebirds leading the way to connection.</p>

  <p class="block_24"><span class="text_32"><br class="calibre7"/></span><span class="text_33">Eye gaze with your partner</span><span class="text_36"> </span><span class="text_38">before the scene, as described in </span><a class="calibre8"><span class="text_38">Chapter 3</span></a><span class="text_38">.</span></p>

  <p class="block_24"><span class="text_32"><br class="calibre7"/></span><span class="text_33">Eye gaze with your partner <i>even if they&#8217;re not gazing back</i></span><span class="text_33">.</span><span class="text_49"> </span><span class="text_17">This came from my friend HoneyCat, who is a rope switch and also knows a thing or two about tantra. Gaze at a spot as close to your partner&#8217;s eyes as you can—maybe it&#8217;s the back of their head; maybe it&#8217;s even their waist—and visualize them gazing back at you.</span></p>

  <p class="block_15">I don&#8217;t remember if HoneyCat said to visualize them doing this adoringly, but that&#8217;s exactly how I do it. I imagine them gazing at me as if they&#8217;re a sculptor and I&#8217;m the most beautiful, amazing creation coming to life under their hands. Not only does this make me feel connected to them while they&#8217;re busy doing the work of tying or whatnot, but it helps boost my confidence and self-esteem.</p>

  <p class="block_24"><span class="text_32"><br class="calibre7"/></span><span class="text_33">Shut out distractions.</span><span class="text_32"> </span><span class="text_17">Maybe you can do this through meditative practices; maybe a blindfold or earplugs would help. (Be aware of the added risks that come with blocking any of your senses, though.) Maybe you want to get tied up only in quieter, private spaces and not noisy, crowded clubs. The more you can minimize distractions and keep your focus more fully on your partner and the rope, the more connected you will likely feel.</span></p>

  <p class="block_24"><span class="text_32"><br class="calibre7"/></span><span class="text_33">Don&#8217;t fight the chemistry.</span><span class="text_32"> </span><span class="text_17">Again, I&#8217;m not a medical professional, but it is generally agreed that in a rope scene (as in other BDSM scenes), the body can release endorphins (hormones that activate the body&#8217;s opiate receptors, similar to morphine), adrenaline (a hormone that&#8217;s part of the &#8220;fight or flight&#8221; response to stress), dopamine (a neurotransmitter involved in the feeling of reward), and oxytocin (a hormone that contributes to feelings of bonding). Let &#8217;em work their magic! They&#8217;re like little golden tickets to the Wonka connection factory. Don&#8217;t second-guess why you&#8217;re feeling so at peace or so attracted to this person or so at one with them even though you may not know them well. Just go with it.</span></p>

  <p class="block_15">These chemicals are very powerful, and below we&#8217;ll discuss ways to handle it when your body and mind return to their everyday state. If you want to learn more about the chemicals themselves, do an online search for &#8220;BDSM brain chemistry&#8221; or &#8220;BDSM biochemistry.&#8221;</p>

  <p class="block_24"><span class="text_32"><br class="calibre7"/></span><span class="text_33">Be physically close during or afterward</span><span class="text_32"> </span><span class="text_17">in whatever way is comfortable to you both. Maybe you just lay your head on your partner&#8217;s lap with their hand in your hair. Maybe you snuggle each other, or you sit on your rope top&#8217;s lap or between their legs on the floor. Maybe it&#8217;s sex. Whatever feels right to you in terms of a physical connection can foster mental and emotional connections too. I&#8217;ve done tying scenes in which I felt like I just wasn&#8217;t able to connect, and then we snuggled afterward and suddenly it was there. Connection can happen at any time. </span></p>

  <p class="block_27">~</p>

  <p class="block_14">If you don&#8217;t make a deep connection, don&#8217;t beat yourself up about it. It&#8217;s not a requirement for a great scene. Just focus on the enjoyable aspects of what you did—your rope high or sense of accomplishment or whatever.</p>

  <p class="block_15">If you do make a deep connection, rah! But also remember the context and that the feeling may be temporary. Rope scenes can be like film sets. Ever notice how actors always seem to be hooking up while they&#8217;re filming a movie together? They get swept up in the drama and passion, and they&#8217;re in close quarters doing intimate scenes. It&#8217;s the same with a rope scene. The emotions can be so intense; you can even feel like your rope top is god-like. Plus there are all those chemicals flowing through your body—remember that some can produce an ecstasy on par with morphine or heroin. The result is that you may feel like you&#8217;re actually in love. Don&#8217;t shut it out or be afraid of it, but realize that it may be temporary and situational.</p>

  <p class="block_15">And please, please, don&#8217;t be a &#8220;stalker&#8221;—someone who is so desperate for or addicted to the thrill of being tied up that they overwhelm the rope top with messages and requests to be tied up again. Showing appreciation is one thing; bombarding someone with inconsiderate neediness is entirely another.</p>

  <h2 class="block_35" id="toc_id_38"><span class="text_25"><br class="calibre7"/></span><span class="text_50" id="id_aftermath">Sub Drop</span></h2>

  <p class="block_14">So you went to heaven and back. You and your rope top felt your souls touch. You reached the heights of transcendence and ended up a quivering mass of spent flesh. Hooray for you! Savor that experience. Feel free to relive it in your mind the next time you&#8217;re stuck in traffic or stressed out, or anytime you need to remember how beautiful and amazing life can be.</p>

  <p class="block_15">But a day or two or even three or four days after the scene (sub drop follows no standard time schedule)…you crash. Maybe the irritability creeps in slowly, and you find yourself snapping at someone over something little. Maybe you wake up one morning in tears. Sub drop takes different forms and comes at different times for everyone, but the bottom line is it can feel like shit—that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s called sub <i class="calibre11">drop</i>. You feel really, really low.</p>

  <p class="block_15">This is completely natural. The same as with drugs you shoot or sniff or drink, your body will go through withdrawal after a great rope scene. How do you cope?</p>

  <p class="block_15">For one thing, I find that good aftercare goes a long way in preventing or alleviating sub drop. It puts a happy closure on the scene, ties it up in a lovely package that then feels complete and more separate. I can take it off my mental shelf and look back on it fondly without being so attached to it.</p>

  <p class="block_15">But without good aftercare (which for me usually involves at least 15 minutes of snuggling or closeness and kind words or looks), I feel set adrift, and the doubts that creep in (&#8220;They didn&#8217;t like me enough to snuggle?&#8221; &#8220;Did I disappoint them?&#8221;) make dealing with sub drop even harder. Figure out what good aftercare is for you, and make sure to negotiate for it.</p>

  <p class="block_15">Next, just recognizing sub drop for what it is can help. You can tell yourself, &#8220;This feeling is totally normal, and it will pass eventually.&#8221; Some people panic and get desperate, the same as with drugs or alcohol, and feel like they need another rope fix <i class="calibre11">right now</i> or they will <i class="calibre11">die</i>. You won&#8217;t die from a lack of rope, I promise. You&#8217;ll just feel really crappy until your body returns fully to its everyday state.</p>

  <p class="block_15">Checking in and sharing your feelings with your partner—again, in a considerate, nonstalkerish way—can help with sub drop as well. A check-in email or phone call should not be considered bothering them; it&#8217;s part of finishing the scene thoughtfully. If anyone makes you feel bad or is dismissive when you try to check in, that&#8217;s a very good reason to consider never playing with them again. </p>

  <p class="block_15">Check-ins can help through the mere refreshing of the connection—hearing your partner&#8217;s voice or reading their message to you. It can also help if there are any lingering doubts about something that happened in the scene. Maybe you&#8217;re obsessing about something you think you did &#8220;wrong,&#8221; and your rope top can set your mind at ease. Maybe there&#8217;s something they did or that happened that made you feel weird, and you&#8217;ll feel better if you tell them. Little doubts and fears and weirdnesses can feel magnified when you have sub drop, so alleviating them can help buoy your spirits.</p>

  <p class="block_15">Being extra kind to yourself in the days after a rope scene can help with sub drop too. Take a nice bath (warm, not hot, if you have bruising), treat yourself to something special (but be careful to not overdose on sugar, which can contribute to the emotional roller coaster), go to bed a little earlier than usual and let your brain process everything at its own pace. Try meditating or exercising—even a gentle walk can help get your mind and body out of sub-drop mode. Talk with kinky friends about how you&#8217;re feeling or post a status on a social networking site. Getting responses and seeing that people care can really help boost a mood.</p>

  <p class="block_15">And consider planning another rope scene, either with the same person or someone else. Having something fun to look forward to can make a big difference.</p>

  <p class="block_30"><span class="text_14">If for some reason you ever feel so low that you&#8217;re actually suicidal, go the nearest emergency room or call the suicide hotline. In the U.S., the number is </span><span class="text_25">1-800-273-8255,</span><span class="text_14"> and you can call 24/7.</span><span class="text_28" id="id_Ninthsection"><br class="calibre5" id="calibre_pb_13"/>
