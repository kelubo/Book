	<p class="block_16"><span class="text_28"><br class="calibre7"/></span><span class="text_14">Let&#8217;s consider two scenarios.</span></p>
	<p class="block_24"><span class="text_17"><br class="calibre7"/></span><span class="text_31">1.</span><span class="text_16"> </span><span class="text_31">Rope top:</span><span class="text_30"> So, any injuries or anything special I should know about?</span></p>
	<p class="block_24"><span class="text_31">Rope bottom:</span><span class="text_52"> </span><span class="text_30">Nah, I&#8217;m pretty good. I promise to tell you if anything feels bad.</span><span class="text_52"> </span></p>
	<p class="block_24"><span class="text_16"><br class="calibre7"/></span><span class="text_31">2.</span><span class="text_17"> </span><span class="text_31">Rope top:</span><span class="text_16"> </span><span class="text_30">So, any injuries or anything special I should know about?</span></p>
	<p class="block_24"><span class="text_31">Rope bottom:</span><span class="text_16"> </span><span class="text_30">No injuries currently, but I had carpal tunnel syndrome last year. I have asthma, and there&#8217;s an inhaler in my bag. There&#8217;s a nerve in my arm here [points]. Also, if you blindfold me and spin me around, I&#8217;ll probably throw up. Aaand, well, it would be really nice if I get to have an orgasm.</span></p>
	<p class="block_14"><i class="calibre11"><br class="calibre7"/></i>It&#8217;s pretty obvious which response is more helpful to a rope top—and whatever helps your rope top will help you too. You don&#8217;t need to share every last detail of your physical and mental state, but providing info on the big issues will help you stay safe and help both of you have a better experience.</p>
	<p class="block_15">It bears repeating here that a good rope top will be able to adjust the tying and the scene to accommodate your injuries, conditions, and state of being. Don&#8217;t be embarrassed or feel like you&#8217;re being difficult. Your partner doesn&#8217;t want to see you get hurt or come away miserable (in unintended ways anyway) any more than you do.</p>
	<p class="block_15">For you to share information, of course, you need to know it. Some of it you already do, and some of it will come through experience. Let&#8217;s break down Helpful Skill No. 4: Knowing Yourself.</p>
	<h2 class="block_35" id="toc_id_23"><span class="text_25"><br class="calibre7"/></span><span class="text_50" id="id_doc">Medical and Physical Conditions</span></h2>
	<p class="block_14">Medical conditions are things like diabetes, asthma, a heart condition, panic attacks, allergies, a history of seizures, circulation issues…anything that has required or might require medical intervention. Even if your condition is under control, it behooves you to disclose this information to your rope top—in the event that it shows up while you&#8217;re tied up, you want your partner to be able to handle it calmly and smoothly, and not waste precious time wondering what the hell is happening to you.</p>
	<p class="block_15">Physical conditions you would do well to disclose are things like breast implants, nerve or joint injuries, relevant surgeries, a bad back, a trick knee, areas of very low or high flexibility, whether you&#8217;re getting over the flu, whether you&#8217;re extra sore from a gym workout…anything going on with your body long-term or short-term that could affect the scene or, more important, your health.</p>
	<h2 class="block_32" id="toc_id_24"><b class="calibre9"><br class="calibre7"/></b><b id="id_mindcon" class="calibre9">Mental Conditions</b></h2>
	<p class="block_14">Rope play, like many other forms of BDSM, can trigger very intense feelings, emotions, and memories. Maybe you love having your wrists tethered to the headboard and your legs closed, but being spread-eagled with your ankles fastened to the bedpost will flash you back to a terrible experience. Maybe you feel fabulous in a hogtie with someone&#8217;s boot pressing your face to the floor, but put a gag on you, and you&#8217;re done. Knowing and communicating your mental and emotional triggers, both major and minor, is important. Gather them in a written or mental database the same as you would medical and physical issues.</p>
	<h2 class="block_32" id="toc_id_25"><b class="calibre9"><br class="calibre7"/></b><b id="id_inmoment" class="calibre9">Situational Issues</b></h2>
	<p class="block_14">Maybe you don&#8217;t have problems with your shoulders while you&#8217;re just walking around the mall, but when your arms are bound behind your back in a box tie for more than 5 minutes, ouch. Maybe your knee is fine when you&#8217;re sitting at your desk, but it&#8217;ll go out 10 minutes into a partial suspension when that leg is bearing all of your weight. Maybe your lower back feels great until you arch it just an inch too far, then you&#8217;ll be in agonizing spasms. These things are sometimes hard to predict—it&#8217;s not like we&#8217;re hanging out in rope by the office water cooler—but you can build your self-knowledge database as you experience them.</p>
	<p class="block_15">It&#8217;s a good idea to check in with your body during the days after a rope scene to see if anything feels unusually painful or strained, and then try to work back to figure out what caused it. (Not always easy—the memory of a rope scene can get very blurry!) For example, maybe you will discover that you have an awfully stiff neck, and perhaps you&#8217;ll ask for neck support the next time you&#8217;re in that same position.</p>
	<p class="block_15">The biggest situational issue can be the most blissful: sub space! What characterizes sub space for you? Maybe you go nonverbal—and if so, how will you communicate with your rope top? Maybe you bark like a dog; telling your partner ahead of time will ensure that they don&#8217;t think you&#8217;re angry and want to be taken out. Pay particular attention to your behavior and abilities or lack thereof while you&#8217;re in sub space, and communicate them to your rope top. If you&#8217;ll be less likely to notice any signs of potential danger or injury, you&#8217;ll need your partner to be extra alert and remind you to check in.</p>
	<h2 class="block_35" id="toc_id_26"><span class="text_25"><br class="calibre7"/></span><span class="text_50" id="id_needs">Knowing Your Wants</span></h2>
	<p class="block_14">Notice that part about the orgasm in situation No. 2 above? Your rope top is not a mind reader, so share what you really want without embarrassment. Maybe it&#8217;s something of a sexual nature; maybe it&#8217;s floating off into sub space; maybe it&#8217;s making an intimate connection. Because we&#8217;re dealing with <i class="calibre11">tops</i> here, however, who may be more or less domly/dommely, sadistic, service-oriented, fluffy, etc., it&#8217;s important to realize that just because you ask for something doesn&#8217;t mean you&#8217;re going to get it, unless you&#8217;ve both negotiated it as a must-do. And even if you&#8217;ve negotiated for something to happen, it might not happen for reasons neither of you could predict.</p>
	<h2 class="block_32" id="toc_id_27"><b class="calibre9"><br class="calibre7"/></b><b id="id_bargain" class="calibre9">Negotiating</b></h2>
	<p class="block_14">Once you know yourself at least a little and what will make a scene fulfilling for you, you can begin negotiating with your rope top for the scene. Negotiation can be as simple or as involved as you choose, but I urge you to err on the side of negotiating more than you think the scene will involve, for one main reason: <i class="calibre11">You will be tied up, may be unable to free yourself, and may have restricted communication abilities! </i>Duuuuh, right?</p>
	<p class="block_15">If you were doing a simple spanking scene with no bondage in a dungeon, presumably you could run away or holler to the dungeon monitor if necessary. If you&#8217;re bound hands and feet to a St. Andrews cross with a blindfold on and a gag in your mouth…hmmm, not so much.</p>
	<p class="block_15">Also, maybe you think rope by itself will make for a spectacular scene (and it sure can), but what if it turns out something added will give it more flavor? A little face slapping, say, or some nipple clamps or paddling? Renegotiating in the middle of a scene generally isn&#8217;t a great idea (endorphin highs do <i class="calibre11">not</i> make for good judgment), so it&#8217;s good to cover all the potential bases ahead of time.</p>
	<p class="block_15">You can find many general BDSM negotiation checklists online; just search for &#8220;BDSM negotiation checklist&#8221; or &#8220;BDSM negotiation form.&#8221; It&#8217;s helpful to consider the potential scene elements in those along with discussing your medical, physical, and mental conditions; your wants; and aftercare. For rope scenes, you&#8217;ll particularly want to discuss the following.</p>
	<p class="block_24" id="toc_1"><span class="text_32"><br class="calibre7"/></span><span class="text_33" id="id_red">Safewords.</span><span class="text_32"> </span><span class="text_17">How will you safeword if you don&#8217;t have use of your hands? The most obvious choice is your voice; you can negotiate to use plain language (in which your communication is taken at face value, such as &#8220;stop&#8221;). Or you can use special spoken words; the most common are &#8220;green&#8221; (&#8220;I love this&#8221;), &#8220;yellow&#8221; (&#8220;Please check in with me&#8221;), and &#8220;red&#8221; (&#8220;Stop immediately&#8221;/&#8220;Get me out right now&#8221;).</span></p>
	<p class="block_15">How can you safeword if you don&#8217;t have your voice? You can use a hand signal. One type is one finger for green, two fingers for yellow, and three fingers for red. Another type is making a fist and then opening all the fingers together, repeatedly, to mean red. A third is the thumbs-up and thumbs-down. You can hold also an object, and if you drop the object, it means red. </p>
	<p class="block_15">How can you safeword if you&#8217;re gagged and your hands are tied? One way is to use a pattern of grunting (three grunts, pause, three grunts, pause). Another is to use a pattern of head shaking (left, right, left, right) or head nodding (forward, back, forward, back). But be extremely careful about using gags with rope, especially in a scene that could cause nausea and vomiting. A ball gag that you can spit out if necessary might be fine, but if you&#8217;re wearing a heavier or tighter gag or a hood that can&#8217;t be easily cut off and you vomit, the results can be disastrous and even fatal.</p>
	<p class="block_15">I also suggest in general that you know and trust your rope top beyond a shadow of a doubt before you do a scene in which both your hands and your voice are severely restricted.</p>
	<p class="block_15">For the scene in the photo below, we agreed on a combination of head motions, grunts, and wiggling to communicate. And that gag was looser than it looks. (Ropework by ModusVitaeSF. Photo by The_Silence.)</p>
	<p class="block_33"> </p>
	<p class="block_40"><br class="calibre7"/><img alt="Image" src="images/gag.jpeg" class="calibre15"/></p>
	<h3 class="block_41" id="toc_id_28"><br class="calibre7"/> </h3>
	<h3 class="block_43" id="toc_id_29"><span class="text_33">How long will you stay in the tie? </span><span class="text_53">Knowing in advance can help you prepare mentally.</span></h3>
	<h3 class="block_43" id="toc_id_30"><span class="text_33">Will you be doing just one tie, or will there be transitions? </span><span class="text_17">Again, knowing can help you prepare mentally and pace yourself.</span></h3>
	<p class="block_17"><span class="text_49"><br class="calibre7"/></span><span class="text_33">Are rope marks OK?</span><span class="text_32"> </span><span class="text_17">How about bruises, cuts, abrasions? Realize that even if you say certain kinds of marks aren&#8217;t OK, they may happen by accident anyway. You can sometimes minimize marks by wearing thin, stretchy leggings and a long-sleeve shirt—try see-through, netting, or lace if standard opaque doesn&#8217;t feel sexy enough.</span></p>
	<p class="block_24"><span class="text_33"><br class="calibre7"/>How much warning time does the top need to untie you?</span><span class="text_32"> </span><span class="text_17">Realize that if you say, &#8220;Get me out now!&#8221; it may take anywhere from 10 seconds to a few minutes for the rope top to actually free you completely. I generally err on the side of overcaution, as you may have guessed by now, so if my partner tells me they need 5 minutes&#8217; notice, I give them at least 7 for my own peace of mind.</span></p>
	<p class="block_24"><span class="text_54"><br class="calibre7"/></span><span class="text_33" id="id_multiple">The Compounding Effect</span></p>
	<p class="block_14">So you love rope, and you love hoods—or clamps or whips or breath play or whatever. If you combine rope with another favorite BDSM practice, it should be double the fun, right? Um…maybe. Rope can heighten your sensations to the point where adding something else can be too much.</p>
	<p class="block_15">If you&#8217;re negotiating as a new rope bottom and haven&#8217;t tried rope combined with your other faves, consider combining conservatively until you know how you&#8217;ll respond. At the very least, tell your rope top it will be a new experience for you doing these things at the same time.</p>
	<h2 class="block_25" id="id_sceneover"><br class="calibre7"/>Aftercare</h2>
	<p class="block_14">Rope scene aftercare can vary widely from person to person, both in what&#8217;s included and the length of time required—some people are good after 5 minutes; some need an hour or more. And needs can change by the day, hour, and scene. Honor whatever you and your partner need in the moment.</p>
	<p class="block_20"><span class="text_22">Aftercare may include snuggling. It will hopefully include snacks, compliments, and gratitude (as discussed in </span><a href="chapter-02.html#id_Thirdsection" class="calibre8"><span class="text_22">Chapter 3</span></a><span class="text_22">, give your rope top aftercare too!). A blanket is lovely as well.</span></p>
	<p class="block_15">If massage is part of your aftercare, avoid massaging, rubbing, or pressing on rope marks and bruises, as it can make them worse. Shay Tiziano, who co-created RemedialRopes.com and is a registered nurse, offers this advice on bruising: Consider applying ice to minimize the bruises or help with the pain. Be careful not to over-ice, which can cause skin damage; gentle cooling for 20 minutes every couple hours should be sufficient. And be aware that NSAIDs can increase bruising.</p>
	<p class="block_15">Also, if you have bruising, you may want to hold off on that hot shower for a couple of days, to avoid making the bruises worse—go lukewarm instead.</p>
	<h2 class="block_32" id="toc_id_31"><b class="calibre9"><br class="calibre7"/></b><b id="id_refusal" class="calibre9">Saying No</b></h2>
	<p class="block_14">Getting to know your body, needs, preferences and pleasures (and developing your instinct) means that you will more readily know what doesn&#8217;t work for you. And that means saying no more often: no to certain ties, no to certain scenes, and no to certain people. If saying no comes easily to you, you can skip ahead.</p>
	<p class="block_15">If, on the other hand, you&#8217;re like me and you generally try hard not to hurt other people&#8217;s feelings, or you tend to want to be accommodating and not seen as difficult, it may take time and effort for you to feel comfortable saying no. But remember that you&#8217;re not doing anyone any favors by agreeing to do something you&#8217;re not really into.</p>
	<p class="block_15">If someone wants to tie you up, but you don&#8217;t feel it&#8217;s the right fit, you can simply say, &#8220;Thank you for the offer, but I&#8217;m going to pass.&#8221; You don&#8217;t need to apologize. You don&#8217;t need to offer an explanation, even if they&#8217;re persistent. (If they press you for a reason, you can always say, &#8220;I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a good fit&#8221; or &#8220;I&#8217;m just not feeling it.&#8221;) You don&#8217;t need to qualify your answer in a way that leaves the door open for the future unless you want to. </p>
	<p class="block_14">The same phrase will work for a particular scene too, or you can say something like, &#8220;That won&#8217;t work for me.&#8221; Knowing yourself will do you no good if you don&#8217;t say no to what you think or know won&#8217;t be good. It is <i class="calibre11">your body</i> and it is <i class="calibre11">your say</i> what you do and don&#8217;t do with it. Use your self-knowledge wisely. </p>
	<p class="block_27">~</p>
	<h2 class="block_25" id="toc_id_32">True Story</h2>
	<p class="block_14">I still cringe thinking about this night. It was my second &#8220;official&#8221; tying scene with a rope top I found very attractive. The first one was at a play party and involved hojojutsu (a rough take-down style). Everything we did in that first scene was consensual, but it turned out to be much rougher than I expected, because the floor was hardwood, I was not that familiar with hojojutsu, and he was a self-identified sadist. There turned out to be no time for aftercare, because he started the scene toward the end of the party. I was covered in huge bruises the next day and feeling tossed to the wind.</p>
	<p class="block_15">I know myself to have a medium pain tolerance, to need some kind of aftercare, and to like to be prepared. So at the next event, I asked for more info about what ties we&#8217;d be doing and what aftercare would look like. He said we would be doing a suspension and that&#8217;s all I needed to know. Period.</p>
	<p class="block_15">If this happened today, I would refuse to do the scene. But because I found him so hot and wanted to please him, and because I wasn&#8217;t very experienced or comfortable saying no at the time, I ignored my instincts, disregarded my self-knowledge, and went ahead with it. And from the very first harsh jerking off the floor to the painful dropping transition where I actually screamed, it was a nightmare. I didn&#8217;t have the right flexibility or pain tolerance for what he wanted to do. In less than 10 minutes I insisted he take me out. </p>
	<p class="block_15">The experience felt even more humiliating because some of my friends were watching. And our aftercare consisted of my sitting at his feet while he hit on another girl.</p>
	<p class="block_15">It certainly didn&#8217;t put me off rope forever, but it did shake me up pretty badly at the time. Now I&#8217;m just glad that nothing more than my pride and heart were injured, because it could&#8217;ve been a lot worse. I remind myself of this experience anytime I consider going against my instinct or discounting my self-knowledge.<span id="id_Seventhsection" class="calibre10"><br class="calibre5" id="calibre_pb_11"/>
