  <h1 class="block_8" id="toc_id_33">Communicating with Your Rope Top</h1>

  <p class="block_24"><span class="text_35"><br class="calibre7"/></span><span class="text_30">Hmmm, this chest harness feels awfully tight; is it supposed to be this tight? I can barely breathe. And my left foot is falling asleep—well, I&#8217;m pretty sure it&#8217;s falling asleep, given the position. Probably not a serious issue, and I don&#8217;t want to bother my partner unless I know it&#8217;s serious. And what was I thinking wearing these stilettos? If I ask to take them off, though, will the whole tie need to be redone? I&#8217;ll just suffer through it. Suffering&#8217;s part of what I signed up for, right? Now I really can&#8217;t feel my foot at all, dammit. I just hope we do a transition soon.</span></p>

  <p class="block_14"><i class="calibre11"><br class="calibre7"/></i>A wonderful rigger I know, ModusVitaeSF, calls suspensions a team sport, and I heartily agree. Helpful Skill No. 5 is Communicating With Your Rope Top because without clear communication, without acting like the team you are part of (as in the example above), you&#8217;re putting both yourself and your top at risk. The risk can range from mere dissatisfaction with the scene to severe injury. And, as if your own injury weren&#8217;t enough of a deterrent, think of the damage to the rope top&#8217;s reputation and peace of mind if you get injured in a scene under their care.</p>

  <p class="block_20"><span class="text_22">We&#8217;ve already covered many things to communicate before a scene in the </span><a class="text_43" href="chapter-05.html#id_Sixthsection">previous chapter</a><span class="text_22">. Here we&#8217;ll discuss what to communicate and what not to in the actual scene and afterward. But first, let&#8217;s talk about </span><span class="text_23">how</span><span class="text_22"> to communicate.</span></p>

  <p class="block_15">The more specific you can be, the better. Saying, &#8220;My hand feels weird&#8221; is a good start if that&#8217;s all you can manage, but saying, &#8220;The wrap on the left wrist is on the bone&#8221; is better. Saying, &#8220;My left leg hurts&#8221; is good, but saying, &#8220;The lowest shin wrap on the left leg—too much pressure&#8221; is better. Speak as calmly, clearly, and succinctly as you can. If you feel yourself starting to panic, tell your partner immediately and try to breathe deeply and calmly until you&#8217;re out.</p>

  <p class="block_15">You may have noticed that in the &#8220;better&#8221; phrases, I used the impersonal &#8220;the&#8221; as opposed to &#8220;my.&#8221; That&#8217;s a personal preference; I feel more objective and less like a complainer using impersonal articles when communicating with my rope top.</p>

  <p class="block_15">Also try to communicate as soon as you notice an issue, to give your partner plenty of time to alleviate it. A minute or two can make a huge difference. If you wait until something is no longer bearable and then yell desperately, &#8220;I need to get out right this second!&#8221; it may affect how safely your rope top can take you out. Cutting someone out of rope is actually riskier than taking them out in a calm, controlled, progressive manner. Also, keep in mind that unpredictable things can happen that might add to the time needed to take you out—a rope may jam, for instance.</p>

  <p class="block_15">Trusting your instinct will go a long way in helping you know which things are worth mentioning—the little voice in your head that is worried about a small thing will most likely turn into a louder voice worrying about a now-bigger thing soon enough. But let&#8217;s cover the major areas. </p>

  <h2 class="block_25" id="id_talkyes"><br class="calibre7"/>What to Communicate During a Scene</h2>

  <p class="block_24"><span class="text_33">Any kind of pain, numbness, or tingling</span><span class="text_32"> </span><span class="text_17">is </span><span class="text_16">always </span><span class="text_17">something to tell your rope top. It doesn&#8217;t matter if it took them 45 minutes to tie you up and you&#8217;ve been in the tie for only 2 minutes. Remember that it doesn&#8217;t matter if you think it&#8217;s &#8220;just&#8221; a circulation issue; the numbness means you wouldn&#8217;t feel a more serious nerve issue, so you should communicate it. It doesn&#8217;t matter if you&#8217;ve seen many other people do this tie with no problems, or if you yourself have done this tie a dozen times with no problems.</span><span class="text_32"> </span><span class="text_33">Itchiness</span><span class="text_49"> </span><span class="text_17">can also be a warning sign—not the kind from a stray hair on your cheek but the kind that covers, say, just your thumb or part of your hand. Tell your rope top immediately to avoid injury.</span></p>

  <p class="block_24"><span class="text_32"><br class="calibre7"/></span><span class="text_33">Dizziness, lightheadedness, nausea, and breathing problems.</span><span class="text_49"> </span><span class="text_17">You can lose consciousness very quickly in rope, and while fainting may not be a life-threatening issue, your rope top would have to deal with getting dead weight untied or cut out of the rope quickly, which is not easy. Similarly, you don&#8217;t want to vomit in rope. Depending on the position, you may choke on your vomit or end up swallowing it back. At the very least, you&#8217;ll make a mess on the rope, yourself, the floor, and possibly your partner. It is much better and safer to avoid fainting and vomiting by telling your rope top when you experience any of the warning signs: dizziness, lightheadedness, seeing stars, wavy vision, nausea, etc. </span></p>

  <p class="block_20"><span class="text_22">There&#8217;s a tragic incident that supports this point: A rope bottom&#8217;s passing out ended in a fatality in a double predicament-bondage scene. See </span><a class="text_24" href="appb.html#toc_id_62">Appendix B</a> <span class="text_22">for the details.</span></p>

  <p class="block_24"><span class="text_17"><br class="calibre7"/></span><span class="text_33">When you&#8217;re having a lot of trouble with something.</span><span class="text_32"> </span><span class="text_17">It could be your shoes or the room temperature or the noise. It could be a headache, or the fact that the rope top has pinched your skin for the 12</span><sup class="text_55">th</sup><span class="text_17"> time while tying you up. Whatever you&#8217;re having so much trouble with that it&#8217;s taking your focus away from the pleasure of being tied is, in my book, worth communicating. Maybe your partner can alleviate the problem, maybe not, but I always feel better at least having mentioned it.</span></p>

  <p class="block_44">If you&#8217;re having trouble with the tie itself for whatever reason, communicate that as well. It doesn&#8217;t matter if the tie is supposedly very easy or gentle, or whether your reasons are physical, mental, or emotional. If you&#8217;re having trouble, you&#8217;re having trouble, and you should tell your partner.</p>

  <p class="block_24"><span class="text_32"><br class="calibre7"/></span><span class="text_33">When you&#8217;re getting spacey.</span><span class="text_32"> </span><span class="text_17">A good rope top will know when you&#8217;re slipping off into sub space; they&#8217;ll see that faraway look or different breathing rate or the change in how you&#8217;re holding your body, for example. But I always like to say it anyway: &#8220;I&#8217;m getting a little spacey.&#8221; Why? Because 1. It lets them know that I might be less able to monitor my own safety, and they will (hopefully) be more watchful on my behalf; 2. It lets them know that my ability to communicate might be affected; and 3. Many rope tops derive satisfaction from seeing their bottoms all blissed out. Why deprive them of your euphoria?</span></p>

  <p class="block_24"><span class="text_17"><br class="calibre7"/></span><span class="text_33">When you&#8217;re starting to fatigue.</span><span class="text_32"> </span><span class="text_17">Try to give your rope top 2 to 5 minutes&#8217; notice, depending on the tie, when either a specific body part is becoming fatigued or you&#8217;re getting tired overall. Maybe they can give you extra support or transition you into a position you can sustain longer. At the very least, they&#8217;ll be able to take you out in a controlled manner.</span></p>

  <p class="block_24"><span class="text_32"><br class="calibre7"/></span><span class="text_33">If someone outside the scene is too close or creeping you out.</span><span class="text_32"> </span><span class="text_17">Your rope top will hopefully be aware if someone is encroaching on your scene space, but sometimes there&#8217;s a lot going on in a club or dungeon, and they may be so focused on tying you that they don&#8217;t notice the person edging over with a crop pointed at your ass. Too many clubgoers and partygoers are not aware of proper scene etiquette, so feel free to ask your rope top to keep an eye on anyone who is getting too close or sending creepy or invasive vibes your way.</span></p>

  <p class="block_24"><span class="text_32"><br class="calibre7"/></span><span class="text_33">When you&#8217;re really enjoying something.</span><span class="text_32"> </span><span class="text_17">Communication doesn&#8217;t have to be just about the negative stuff; share the positive too! Presumably your partner will know by the look on your face or your enraptured moans how much you&#8217;re enjoying something, but feel free to say things like, &#8220;This is so hot&#8221; or &#8220;I am so turned on right now&#8221; or &#8220;You are totally rocking my world&#8221; or whatever. Who doesn&#8217;t like to hear when something&#8217;s going right?</span></p>

  <h2 class="block_32" id="toc_id_34"><b class="calibre9"><br class="calibre7"/></b><b id="id_talkno" class="calibre9">What Not to Communicate in a Scene</b></h2>

  <p class="block_14">Let&#8217;s start by admitting that sometimes the actual tying part of a rope scene can be boring. Not if you&#8217;re doing hojojutsu or any kind of resistance play, of course, or ichinawa, or if your partner otherwise makes the tying part of the fun. But some ties, especially for suspensions, are more complicated than others; some rope tops are slower than others; some make a connective, intimate act of tying and some don&#8217;t. And your natural M.O. may be to fill boring voids with small talk. I urge you not to.</p>

  <p class="block_15">Why? Because 1. Do you want your rope top focusing on having a conversation, or do you want them focusing on tying you safely and pleasurably? And 2. Making idle conversation will put your own focus outside of the scene.</p>

  <p class="block_15">Here are a few things you might want to keep silent about as soon as the rope touches your body:</p>

  <p class="block_24"><span class="text_32"><br class="calibre7"/></span><span class="text_33">Comments on the other clubgoers.</span><span class="text_32"> </span><span class="text_17">Who&#8217;s coming and going; who&#8217;s there with whom; who&#8217;s wearing what.</span></p>

  <p class="block_24"><span class="text_33"><br class="calibre7"/>Questions or comments about the rope or the tie for the mere sake of conversation,</span><span class="text_32"> </span><span class="text_17">like, &#8220;Ooh that&#8217;s really pretty; the last time I did this tie, it didn&#8217;t have the same symmetry.&#8221;</span></p>

  <p class="block_24"><span class="text_33"><br class="calibre7"/>Anything relationship- or dating-related,</span><span class="text_32"> </span><span class="text_17">like, &#8220;So what do you want to do for Valentine&#8217;s Day?&#8221; or, &#8220;Hey, are you still seeing that hottie from the café?&#8221;</span></p>

  <p class="block_24"><span class="text_33"><br class="calibre7"/>Anything related to the everyday,</span><span class="text_32"> </span><span class="text_17">like, &#8220;What do you want for dinner tonight?&#8221; or &#8220;Oh, I picked up the dry cleaning, so can you please remember to take that stuff to Goodwill?&#8221; <br class="calibre7"/> </span></p>

  <p class="block_24"><span class="text_33"><br class="calibre7"/>News, politics, celebrity gossip, the weather, the fight you had with your boss, etc.</span><span class="text_36"> </span><span class="text_38">You get the idea. If it&#8217;s not helping either of you become more fully immersed in the scene, it can probably wait. If you&#8217;re bored, try some of the meditative practices outlined in </span><a href="chapter-02.html#id_Thirdsection" class="calibre8"><span class="text_38">Chapter 3</span></a><span class="text_38"> or the connective practices described in </span><a href="#id_Eighthsection" class="calibre8"><span class="text_38">Chapter 8</span></a><span class="text_38">.</span><span class="text_36"> </span></p>

  <h2 class="block_25" id="toc_id_35">True Story</h2>

  <p class="block_14">A rigger and I had spent some time working out variations of an inverted suspension from a single-leg futomomo (in which the leg is bent at the knee and rope binds the shin to the thigh) in a class earlier that day. I found all the variations we did in the class really painful and lasted no more than 2 minutes in any of them. But I kept the shrieks internal and tried to calmly answer his questions and communicate what was working and what wasn&#8217;t. Together we worked out what hypothetically would be the best combination of rope placement, tension, etc. He thought adding support lines on both sides of the leg, instead of having just the traditional single support line, would help alleviate the pressure.</p>

  <p class="block_15">Later that night at a party, we decided to try it out. First, I was nervous about the hardpoint, because we had never suspended there before and the floor was hardwood—nothing to cushion a skull should anything fail. I kept the fear to myself for a while, then realized it was taking my focus away. So I communicated my concern, and the rope top reassured me about its safety (relative safety anyway, as suspensions are edge play and risky already, and doing an inversion over a hardwood floor even more so). I felt better immediately, and my focus returned.</p>

  <p class="block_15">When he pulled me into the air, the pain was again immediate and acute despite the two support lines. But after I spent a minute breathing deeply and visualizing the pain spreading to nontied body parts, the bliss washed over me like a wave. All of that back-and-forth communication earlier had paid off!</p>

  <p class="block_15">But here&#8217;s where we get to the really impressive communication. Because this rigger had never done that exact tie with two support lines, the rope jammed as he started untying. (By that time I had been upside down in the futomomo for maybe 10 or 15 minutes.) Very calmly and matter-of-factly, he said, &#8220;This is nothing to worry about, but the rope has jammed, and I&#8217;m going to ask X to hold you while I get it out.&#8221;</p>

  <p class="block_30"><span class="text_14">If I had detected even one note of tension or panic in his voice, or if he had decided to not communicate to me what was happening at all, and just had someone come in to hold me up without telling me why, I might easily have panicked—especially given my earlier fear about hitting the hardwood head first. But his communication made all the difference. X held me up, the rope top unjammed the rope, and I got out safely—and with bliss</span><span class="text_28"> </span><span class="text_14">intact.</span><span class="text_14" id="id_Eighthsection"><br class="calibre5" id="calibre_pb_12"/>
