	<p class="block_16"><span class="text_28"><br class="calibre7"/></span><span class="text_14">Once you&#8217;ve determined what type of experience turns you on, the next step is finding someone to have it with—unless you&#8217;re into self-bondage, which is outside the scope of this book. If you already have a partner who&#8217;s into rope, lucky you! You can skip ahead.</span></p>
	<h2 class="block_25" id="toc_id_7"><br class="calibre7"/>Ways to Find a Rope Top</h2>
	<p class="block_21"><a href="https://fetlife.com/" class="calibre8"><span class="text_37">FetLife</span></a><span class="text_37">.com.</span><span class="text_41"> </span><span class="text_38">There are many resources on this valuable site. You can find out about local rope munches and chapters of the group Rope Bite, peer rope workshops, classes, and rope communities; you can even place a personal ad for a rope partner. Another BDSM-oriented social networking site is Collarspace.com. It&#8217;s more focused on dating, and I have no personal experience with it. </span></p>
	<p class="block_24"><span class="text_32"><br class="calibre7"/></span><span class="text_33">Workshops and classes.</span><span class="text_32"> </span><span class="text_17">Rope tops are often looking for bottoms to attend classes with. You may think classes for tops are boooooring and have nothing to teach you about getting tied up. Not so fast! I&#8217;m a big believer in bottoming at classes because:</span></p>
	<p class="block_14"><b class="calibre9"><br class="calibre7"/>1.</b> You can always learn something from watching and talking with the other bottoms.</p>
	<p class="block_14"><b class="calibre9">2.</b> It&#8217;s a great way to get to know a rope top in a casual and safer setting.</p>
	<p class="block_14"><b class="calibre9">3.</b> Education and practice make rope tops better, and better rope tops make for better bottoming experiences! </p>
	<p class="block_16"><span class="text_28"><br class="calibre7"/></span><span class="text_14">Just don&#8217;t expect classes to be actual scenes, though. While you may be lucky and get a few minutes of scene-type play during practice time, the rope tops are there to learn, not to fulfill your fantasies. If you think it&#8217;s not worth it, consider negotiating for something in exchange for your time: dinner out or a massage or whatever you feel is fair. </span></p>
	<p class="block_24"><span class="text_32"><br class="calibre7"/></span><span class="text_33">Conferences</span><span class="text_42">.</span><span class="text_17"> In the U.S., some big ones are Shibaricon, Rope Camp and Bondage Expo Dallas. There are of course others all over the world, such as BoundCon. And there are usually partner-finding threads either through FetLife or the conference itself, so you can even attend without a partner and still have a fabulous learning and playing experience.</span></p>
	<p class="block_24"><span class="text_32"><br class="calibre7"/></span><span class="text_33">Play parties.</span><span class="text_32"> </span><span class="text_17">From dungeons to play spaces to bars to private homes, there are play parties in all the major cities and smaller ones too. You may meet someone there, or maybe you&#8217;ll see someone doing a scene whom you&#8217;ll want to get to know more in the future. </span><span class="text_16">Do not</span><span class="text_17"> ever interrupt a scene, however. If the scene is clearly over and the players have separated, it&#8217;s perfectly OK to approach the rope top and introduce yourself. It would not, however, be OK to sidle up to the rope top as they&#8217;re untying their bottom and say, &#8220;Can you do me next?&#8221;</span></p>
	<p class="block_15">If you do approach someone who is partnered, whether the partner is present or not and whether the relationship is an open one or not, please be considerate of both parties. Unless the partner is a slave or owned, or a protocol is in place that would make directly contacting them inappropriate (check with the top if in doubt), I think it&#8217;s good old-fashioned courtesy to check in with both people initially. Their heartfelt relationship is deeper than our rope lust.</p>
	<p class="block_15">But it&#8217;s more than that too. I think all of us bottoms are united on some level, and that we should treat each other kindly and thoughtfully. We&#8217;re not competing with one another; we have similar desires and needs, and there&#8217;s plenty of rope play to go around. Treat other rope bottoms as you would want to be treated.</p>
	<p class="block_24"><span class="text_17"><br class="calibre7"/></span><span class="text_33">Referrals.</span><span class="text_32"> </span><span class="text_17">Get to know the other rope bottoms in your area and ask who they&#8217;ve been tied by and who they recommend. Again, be up-front and mindful of not &#8220;stealing&#8221; someone else&#8217;s rope partner, though—ask if they mind if you contact the person. You can also let rope instructors know you&#8217;re available if any of their students need a rope bottom.</span></p>
	<p class="block_24"><span class="text_32"><br class="calibre7"/></span><span class="text_33">Other online sources.</span><span class="text_32"> </span><span class="text_17">You can find pretty much anything online these days. But while sites like Craigslist are great for many things, rope play is a hell of a lot riskier than buying a toaster. Do you really want to add unnecessary risk by getting tied up by someone who can remain completely anonymous, unknown, and unaccountable to any sort of community?</span><span class="text_32"> </span></p>
	<p class="block_27">~</p>
	<p class="block_14">Overall, be proactive about finding a rope top! Yes, it takes guts. Yes, you may get turned down—maybe several times. But my experience has been that if you just sit around waiting for someone to ask to tie you up, you&#8217;re going to have a sore butt for all the wrong reasons. </p>
	<p class="block_15">I&#8217;m constantly putting myself out there. I get turned down. I&#8217;ve experienced what felt like downright snubbing. (But who knows what kind of day the person was having?) But I also get tied up a lot. So don&#8217;t take a turn-down personally, and realize that if you ask 10 people and 3 say yes, you&#8217;re probably getting tied at least 3 more times than if you had sat around waiting for someone to ask you. A sense of entitlement won&#8217;t serve you here.</p>
	<h2 class="block_25" id="toc_id_8"><br class="calibre7"/>How to Evaluate a Rope Top</h2>
	<p class="block_14">So you&#8217;ve been proactive and found someone you might be interested in. Hooray! Now do you just strip, throw your arms out, and cry, &#8220;Take me!&#8221;? Of course not. First you need to establish that the rope top is skilled in safety and in creating the kind of experience you&#8217;re looking for.</p>
	<p class="block_15">Note that I said &#8220;skilled in safety&#8221; and not &#8220;safe.&#8221; Just as the only true form of safe sex is abstinence, the only true form of total rope safety is not getting tied up. Sometimes things happen that even the most experienced, safety-conscious top couldn&#8217;t have planned for, like natural disasters or unexpected seizures or heart attacks. But you do want to ensure that your partner knows how to minimize the risks.</p>
	<p class="block_20"><span class="text_22">I&#8217;ll give you some pointers for evaluating a rope top before, during, and after a scene in a minute, but the most important factor here brings us to Helpful Skill No. 3: Trusting Your Instinct. It&#8217;s that little or even loud voice that urges caution or gives you the green light, that weird feeling you get when a person says or does something, that thought you can&#8217;t even put a name to that leans you toward aye or nay. Instinct does not need a rationale or a name or even a fully formed thought. Learn to hear it, feel it, and honor it. Your instinct is perhaps the most helpful of the Helpful Skills you will ever have in your rope bottoming toolkit. We&#8217;ll cover it more in </span><a class="text_43" href="chapter-04.html#id_Fifthsection">Chapter 5</a><span class="text_22">.</span></p>
	<p class="block_15">Not all of the following suggestions are always possible to do, but the more you can, the better assured you&#8217;ll be that you and your rope top are the right fit for each other—or not. Also, be aware that the only experience that will be reliable for you is your own. Whatever you see in another scene or hear from another person is only one version of the story, so take all input outside your own experience with a grain of salt.</p>
	<h3 class="block_25" id="toc_id_9"><br class="calibre7"/>Before the Scene</h3>
	<p class="block_16"><span class="text_44">Watch the rope top do a scene with someone else.</span><span class="text_28"> </span><span class="text_14">Do they seem to be checking in with their bottom regularly? Do they seem focused on what they&#8217;re doing, or are they looking around at people walking in and out, waving to friends, etc.? Do they seem calm and confident, or fumbling and uncertain? Do they seem to be enjoying the scene or merely killing time? Do their style, demeanor, and bearing seem like a good fit for you?</span></p>
	<p class="block_15">This could also be a good time to surreptitiously eye their rope and gear. Is the rope clean and in good condition? If the rope top uses rope in the crotch area or in the mouth, do they toss it back afterward in the same pile as the other ropes (can I get an &#8220;Ewwww!&#8221; here?), or do they put it in a Ziploc bag or otherwise keep it separate? Do they have safety shears within reach?</p>
	<p class="block_15">If you have the chance to observe them more than once, do they seem to choose experienced and empowered bottoms, newbies, or a mix? If I see someone who tends to go mostly for newbies, it&#8217;s like they have a big, flashing marquee warning sign over their head. What exactly about experienced bottoms doesn&#8217;t appeal to them? Hmmm…</p>
	<p class="block_16"><span class="text_14"><br class="calibre7"/></span><span class="text_44">Ask about training and experience.</span><span class="text_28"> </span><span class="text_14">This might take some finesse, because you don&#8217;t want it to feel like the Spanish Inquisition. Rope tops can be just as sensitive as anyone else (surprise!), and you don&#8217;t want the first impression to be that you&#8217;re doubting their skills.</span></p>
	<p class="block_15">I like to feel out sensitivity by starting with a compliment, like: &#8220;Hey, that hogtie [suspension, takedown scene…] you did was so hot. Did you learn those moves in a class or did you teach yourself?&#8221; Then you can see how open they are to discussing their experience. Anyone who has trained formally is usually happy to talk about it, so if the person is vague or refuses to discuss it at all, you may want to seriously consider moving on to someone else.</p>
	<p class="block_16"><span class="text_28"><br class="calibre7"/></span><span class="text_44">Ask for references and actually contact them.</span><span class="text_28"> </span><span class="text_14">Landlords do it; hiring companies do it—and your physical and mental safety is worth way more than any rental or job. You should absolutely ask for references and not feel weird about it. Again, do this with consideration. You can say, &#8220;I like to prepare as much as much as possible to make sure we both have a good time. Do you mind if I talk with some people you&#8217;ve tied?&#8221;</span></p>
	<p class="block_20"><span class="text_22">Again, though, remember that the people you talk with are giving you only one side of the experience. Also, it should go without saying that you should keep anything you hear in strictest confidence unless the person gives you permission to share the information. (See the terrific article &#8220;</span><a class="text_43" href="http://kinkyclover.com/rope-bondage-references/">Rope Bondage References</a><span class="text_22">&#8221; on </span><a class="text_43" href="http://kinkyclover.com/">KinkyClover.com</a><span class="text_22"> for more helpful info; Clover, who wrote it, is a well-known and highly respected rope bottom.)</span></p>
	<p class="block_16"><span class="text_28"><br class="calibre7"/></span><span class="text_44">Evaluate the rope top on a physical level.</span><span class="text_28"> </span><span class="text_14">Do they have any physical conditions, such as diabetes or a history of seizures, and if so, are they taking care of those conditions appropriately? Do they have any physical limitations? If you&#8217;ll be doing a suspension, are they able to support your body alone if something goes wrong, or would a spotter be necessary? Tifereth, a well-known and highly respected rope bottom </span><span class="text_45">and</span><span class="text_14"> top, recommends that they be able to support a minimum of 50 percent of your body weight if no spotter is present.</span></p>
	<p class="block_15">Do you see the top drinking or doing drugs? One scotch might make for a nice, relaxed rope session, but being obviously intoxicated should throw up a big red flag for you.</p>
	<p class="block_16"><span class="text_44">Do a mini scene.</span><span class="text_28"> </span><span class="text_14">If you&#8217;re thinking of suspending with someone, do a more casual floor scene first, where the risk of injury is lower. If you&#8217;re thinking of doing a floor scene with someone, ask them to tie a simple chest harness or hogtie on you first. How they handle a mini scene is a good indication of how they&#8217;ll handle a more intense one.</span></p>
	<h3 class="block_25" id="toc_id_10"><br class="calibre7"/>During the Scene</h3>
	<p class="block_14">Time for another warning. This one should be common sense, but we all know how rare common sense is these days.</p>
	<p class="block_16"><span class="text_28"><br class="calibre7"/></span><span class="text_15">Warning: Do not go to a stranger&#8217;s house alone for your first tying scene. </span></p>
	<p class="block_16"><span class="text_26"><br class="calibre7"/></span><span class="text_14">Call me overcautious here, but I say don&#8217;t rely on safe calls, don&#8217;t rely on references, don&#8217;t rely on word of mouth that a rope top is safe. You have only one life and one body. Don&#8217;t risk them on a rope scene. Even if you&#8217;re pretty sure the person is not a serial killer, a wide range of other horrors can happen when you&#8217;re alone with someone while tied up—as in, </span><span class="text_45">helpless:</span><span class="text_14"> mental torture, physical abuse, rape…use your imagination.</span></p>
	<p class="block_15">While you&#8217;re getting to know your rope top, meet in a place where other people will be around—a dungeon monitor is ideal, but just having any other people present will lower the likelihood that your rope top will abuse you in a way you haven&#8217;t negotiated.</p>
	<p class="block_16"><span class="text_28"><br class="calibre7"/></span><span class="text_44">Check in with your rope top right before your scene, using your voice, ears, and eyes.</span><span class="text_28"> </span><span class="text_14">I usually start by asking, &#8220;How was your day?&#8221; If they say they had a stressful day at work, got cut off on the highway, and didn&#8217;t have time for dinner…well, it&#8217;s time to relax and get some food first. Especially if we&#8217;re tying at a place where alcohol is being served, I&#8217;ll say, &#8220;I&#8217;ve had a half a glass of wine. How about you?&#8221; Look into their eyes. Do they seem clear, focused, and confident? Sleepy, shifty, or glassy? What is your instinct telling you about their ability to keep you safe for this particular scene, in this location, at this moment?</span></p>
	<p class="block_16"><span class="text_28"><br class="calibre7"/></span><span class="text_15">Warning: Do not get tied up if you or your partner is intoxicated or under the influence of drugs.</span></p>
	<p class="block_16"><span class="text_26"><br class="calibre7"/></span><span class="text_14">Your and their judgment, balance, coordination, and self-awareness will be compromised if you&#8217;re intoxicated or high. Rope tying is potentially dangerous already, and even what seems like a simple scene can go horribly wrong. Don&#8217;t take on the added risk. There is always another chance to be tied up.</span></p>
	<p class="block_15">I personally don&#8217;t feel intoxicated after one drink if I&#8217;ve eaten something, and in fact, it sometimes helps calm my nerves before an intense scene. Your tolerance may be higher or lower. Know yourself and err on the side of being overcautious.</p>
	<p class="block_16"><span class="text_28"><br class="calibre7"/></span><span class="text_44">Continue evaluating during the scene.</span><span class="text_28"> </span><span class="text_14">Do you feel like you&#8217;re being handled safely? If something doesn&#8217;t feel right, even if you&#8217;re not sure exactly what feels wrong (&#8220;Gee, isn&#8217;t that rope awfully close to my windpipe?&#8221; &#8220;Hmm, my leg doesn&#8217;t really go that way&#8221;), tell your rope top. And if too many weird feelings happen or your partner isn&#8217;t responding appropriately to your concerns, it may be time to consider coming out of the rope entirely.</span></p>
	<p class="block_15">Does your rope top leave you alone at all during the scene? If one of your hands is free and scissors are within reach while your top uses the restroom 5 feet away, that&#8217;s one thing. But in general your partner should be with you at all times while you&#8217;re tied up, and if they&#8217;re not and they haven&#8217;t arranged for someone else to &#8220;babysit&#8221; you, that&#8217;s another big red flag and maybe even a reason to safeword out of (meaning end) the scene.</p>
	<h3 class="block_25" id="toc_id_11"><br class="calibre7"/>After the Scene</h3>
	<p class="block_16"><span class="text_44">Did the scene end smoothly or abruptly?</span><span class="text_28"> </span><span class="text_14">Was the transition out of the scene appropriate? Did you have to safeword out? Did you feel spacey, spent, and settled? Tense, irritated, and angry? How your rope top handles the ending is just as important as the beginning.</span></p>
	<p class="block_19"><span class="text_19"><br class="calibre7"/></span><span class="text_46">Are you getting the aftercare you negotiated for?</span><span class="text_47"> </span><span class="text_20">More on negotiation in </span><a href="chapter-05.html#id_Sixthsection" class="calibre8"><span class="text_20">Chapter 6</span></a><span class="text_20">, but let&#8217;s assume you discussed some kind of aftercare. Is your rope top still being considerate of you and giving you the time you need to reconnect with the world, or are they rushing you to recover because they need to be somewhere or want to play with someone else? Appropriate aftercare can make a big difference in how you feel in the days to come, when you may experience sub drop or withdrawal. (More on sub drop in </span><a href="chapter-07.html#id_Eighthsection" class="calibre8"><span class="text_20">Chapter 8</span></a><span class="text_20">.) </span></p>
	<p class="block_27">~</p>
	<h2 class="block_25" id="toc_id_12">True Story</h2>
	<p class="block_14">Very early in my rope days, I met a rope top at a party. He had a reputation for being knowledgeable and experienced, and we did a brief, casual scene that night in which I was tied to a chair. My leg was in the air, and my foot started to go numb. I told him, and he looked at all the rope placements and said it was fine, there was no danger of nerve damage. After another 5 minutes I said I was not OK with the numbness and wanted to come out, so he took me out. The circulation to my foot returned in a few minutes and all was fine.</p>
	<p class="block_15">About two months later, we were doing an inverted suspension (meaning head near the floor and feet in the air) at a club. My neck and shoulder started to feel weird, and I told him immediately. He glanced at the rope placement and deemed it not a major issue; he finished what he was doing after a minute or two and then adjusted the bothersome rope. When I came out of the rope later, I could not raise my arm above the level of my shoulder on its own. It took <i class="calibre11">6 weeks for the nerve damage to heal</i> and for me to regain full use of my arm.</p>
	<p class="block_14">If I had been more experienced or aware, I would have realized from that very first scene that the rope top valued his own judgment more than the bottom&#8217;s input, which can increase the chance of injury. Pay attention to your partner&#8217;s behavior even in small scenes; this can help you when you&#8217;re considering other, more intense scenes in the future. </p>
