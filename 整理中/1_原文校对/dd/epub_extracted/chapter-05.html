	<h1 class="block_8" id="toc_id_20">Trusting Your Instinct</h1>

	<p class="block_24"><span class="text_35"><br class="calibre7"/></span><span class="text_30">Gee, that rope feels kinda tight on my ribcage. Should I say something? But I guess it&#8217;s OK, because I can still breathe, if not deeply. My thumb feels weird too, but I can still move it, and it&#8217;s not even tingling, so that&#8217;s probably fine too. Yipes, rope on my private parts? We didn&#8217;t discuss that, and it makes me feel uneasy, but I didn&#8217;t say it was a limit, so I&#8217;ll just suck it up. OK now my thumb really is tingling, but this tie took 30 minutes, and I&#8217;ve only been in it for 5. I really don&#8217;t want to ruin the scene. I&#8217;ll just tough it out…</span></p>
	<p class="block_14"><i class="calibre11"><br class="calibre7"/></i>This type of thinking, in which you ignore your instinct, can lead to injury. Probably every rope bottom has this kind of internal dialogue at some point, if not every single time they&#8217;re in rope. The biggest question I had when I started getting tied up was, &#8220;Is it <i class="calibre11">supposed</i> to be this painful, or am I just a wuss?&#8221; It can be difficult, especially when you&#8217;re a beginner, to know what kind of pain is to be expected and what kind is a signal that something is wrong.</p>
	<p class="block_15">There is no easy answer, alas. The only way to figure it out is through experience and talking with other rope bottoms and tops. Having the same tie done by different people can also be insightful, because every rope top&#8217;s style, placement, and tension are slightly different. There are often also many variations of any tie—some hogties are so comfy that you could do the <i class="calibre11">New York Times</i> crossword puzzle in them (well, if you could write with a pen in your nose). Some ties are just painful by nature, but it takes time and practice to figure out which ones. </p>
	<p class="block_15">But while experience takes time to acquire, instinct is something you already possess and can access immediately—you just have to learn how to hear it and honor it. </p>
	<p class="block_15">Merriam-Webster defines &#8220;instinct&#8221; as:</p>
	<p class="block_37"><span class="text_17"><br class="calibre7"/></span><span class="text_51">A way of behaving, thinking, or feeling that is not learned…behavior that is mediated by reactions below the conscious level.</span></p>
	<p class="block_24"><span class="text_51"><br class="calibre7"/></span><span class="text_17">Sometimes instinct has a voice, as in, &#8220;I need to get out of this rope right now!&#8221; Sometimes it&#8217;s more of a not-fully-formed feeling—that &#8220;Spidey sense.&#8221; As mentioned, instinct does not need a logical reason or justification. It plays beyond the realm of the rational. Don&#8217;t let your conscious reasoning override it.</span></p>
	<p class="block_15">Let&#8217;s say you&#8217;ve attended a class with a world-famous rope bondage instructor who has been tying people up for years and is also super hot. You take a shine to each other, and the instructor is leaving the next day but wants to tie you up that night in their hotel room. &#8220;What a fabulous opportunity!&#8221; you think. &#8220;And how can I go wrong with a world-famous rope bondage instructor?&#8221;</p>
	<p class="block_15">But then your Spidey sense starts tingling. Why are they insisting on the hotel room instead of the popular party when you&#8217;ve said no sex? Why are they not quite looking you completely in the eyes? Why did their bottoming partner in the class look annoyed? Something just doesn&#8217;t seem right here—and even if all the facts look fine on paper, your instinct has the right of veto. </p>
	<p class="block_38">Of course, I&#8217;m not saying to be more or less wary of world-famous rope instructors! The few I&#8217;ve met have been wonderful. (And most stay at people&#8217;s houses, not hotels.) But you get the point. Don&#8217;t let a &#8220;great opportunity&#8221; or fame or hotness or anything else override your instinct.</p>
	<p class="block_15">Trusting your instinct will serve you in every aspect of a rope scene, beginning with evaluating rope tops. It will also help you avoid the tough-it-out mentality that can lead to injury. You know that mentality, right? Maybe the tie took a long time, or people are watching, or you don&#8217;t want to disappoint your partner or ruin the scene, or you think your pain tolerance &#8220;should&#8221; be higher or your stamina &#8220;should&#8221; be greater. So you push past what you know is right for you. But to stay safe, you must chuck this mentality out the window. </p>
	<p class="block_15">In the photo below, my instinct told me that candle would be trouble. And yup, the wax spilled all over me, the rope, and the floor when I twitched. But the rope top knew I liked wax play, so it was all good. (Ropework and photo by Cryptocat.)</p>

	<p class="block_15">&#8220;Should&#8221;s have no place in rope bondage. There is only what you can and cannot do <i class="calibre11">in the moment</i>. Even if you&#8217;ve done a tie a dozen times with no problem, if you are having an issue this particular time, you need to address it. Second, remember that you can always get tied up again—maybe even in the next few minutes!—<i class="calibre11">except</i> if you get injured.</p>
	<p class="block_15">If you&#8217;re having an issue, and your partner makes an adjustment, you still want to listen to your instinct about whether the adjustment alleviated the problem. If not, you&#8217;ll need to tell them. Don&#8217;t feel like you&#8217;re being a complainer. Just say calmly that you&#8217;re still having the issue.</p>
	<p class="block_14">If you&#8217;re worried that your rope top will end the scene completely, tell them you&#8217;d like to continue in a different form if possible. Experienced rope tops should be able to switch the tie so it works better. Less experienced tops might have to take you out completely, but then just tell them how much you would like them to retie you. </p>

	<h2 class="block_25" id="toc_id_21">True Story</h2>
	<p class="block_14">The scene was a very stylish BDSM party in another city. I had been hooked up with a rope top through a mutual friend in San Francisco, and we&#8217;d exchanged a few messages but had never met in person. I knew this person had been doing rope for years, had studied internationally, and taught classes. Did I want to live up to his abilities? Hell, yes. Did I want to show my friend back home that he could confidently recommend me to all of his hot rope top friends around the world in the future? Fer sure! Also, I felt a chemistry right away with this person and did not want to disappoint him.</p>
	<p class="block_15">He put me in a box tie, which I&#8217;d done too many times to count, and started pulling the ropes through the suspension ring and hoisting me up in the air. A spot on my arm immediately and loudly complained in a way that I knew was not normal. I told the rope top, he adjusted the placement of the rope, and we went back to it. My arm kept on hurting, and I started mentally beating myself up for being such a lame-ass over that one little spot. I really considered toughing it out, but then good sense kicked in.</p>
	<p class="block_15">&#8220;I&#8217;m really sorry, but that arm is just no good,&#8221; I said. &#8220;I really don&#8217;t want to come out completely, though. Can we please switch to something else?&#8221; Without missing a beat, he switched to a partial suspension that took the pressure off the arm.</p>
	<p class="block_14">And at some point when I stopped mentally beating myself up again for being able to do &#8220;only&#8221; a partial, guess what? We had a really great, hot scene. And another one the next night. And we&#8217;re planning to get together the next time I&#8217;m in town. If I hadn&#8217;t listened to my instinct and communicated the issue, not only might I have gotten injured, but I likely wouldn&#8217;t have been able to drop into the scene as fully, because I would have been too focused on that damn arm. </p>

	<h2 class="block_25" id="id_howto">3 Easy Ways to Develop Instinct</h2>
	<p class="block_14">If you feel like your sixth sense is more like six galaxies away, don&#8217;t give up on it. There are ways to boost the ability to hear, feel, and trust your instinct. And a more finely tuned instinct will actually help you in life, not just in rope.</p>
	<p class="block_15">These came from different sources over the years that I can&#8217;t remember anymore, so unfortunately there are no credits. Also, again, these work for me but might not for you. Experiment, research, and develop your own methods—much has been written on the subject of developing instinct (like <i class="calibre11">The Gift of Fear,</i> by Gavin de Becker) and there are many more methods than just these.</p>
	<p class="block_24"><span class="text_33">The finger snap test. </span><span class="text_17">Let&#8217;s say you&#8217;re weighing two options—for example, should you go on a date with a certain person or not. Snap your fingers and listen to the first answer that pops into your head: yes or no. If your fingers happen to be tied and you can&#8217;t actually snap them, just visualize it.</span></p>
	<p class="block_24"><span class="text_32"><br class="calibre7"/></span><span class="text_33">Practice guessing.</span><span class="text_32"> </span><span class="text_17">At least once a day, when you make a choice that you&#8217;re not certain about—it could be as simple as what to have for breakfast or what outfit to wear—guess ahead of time how you&#8217;ll feel about your decision later. Then check in with yourself later to see if you were right.</span><span class="text_32"> </span></p>
	<p class="block_24"><span class="text_32"><br class="calibre7"/></span><span class="text_33">Get out of your head. </span><span class="text_17">As mentioned, doing anything physical will help take your focus away from your thoughts. Have you ever noticed how you can think more clearly after exercising, how suddenly the answer to a question or problem you&#8217;d been having is right there in front of you? It&#8217;s because you&#8217;ve cleared your conscious thoughts away to make room for instinct to surface.</span></p>
	<p class="block_15">Similarly, doing something creative can help you get out of your head and tap into your instincts, even if the activity isn&#8217;t highly physical, like drawing or playing the guitar. </p>
	<p class="block_27">~</p>
	<p class="block_16"><span class="text_14">Now that we&#8217;ve covered the subconscious information gathering that is instinct, let&#8217;s move on to information gathering on a more conscious level: knowing yourself.</span><span class="text_28" id="id_Sixthsection"><br class="calibre5" id="calibre_pb_10"/>
